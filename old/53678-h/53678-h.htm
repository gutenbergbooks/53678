<h2 class="h2nobreak" id="p-v">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>It
may be thought presumptuous in a
person who has never had the curiosity to
peruse the British classic authors on planting
and timber—<span class="smcap">E<b>VELYN</b></span>, <span class="smcap">H<b>ANBURY</b></span>, <span class="smcap">M<b>ARSHALL</b></span>,
<span class="smcap">M<b>ILLER</b></span>, <span class="smcap">P<b>ONTEY</b></span>—to make experiment
of the public sufferance. The author
does not, however, think any apology
necessary; as, if the public lose time unprofitably
over his pages, he considers the blame
attachable to them, not to him. A writer
does not obtrude as a speaker does, but
merely places his thoughts within reach.</p>

<p class="padtopb">As the subject, notwithstanding its great
importance, might, <i>per se</i>, be felt dry and
<span class="xxpn" id="p-vi">{vi}</span>
insipid by the general reader, accustomed
to the luxuries of modern literature, the
author has not scrupled to mix with it such
collateral matter as he thought might serve
to correct the aridity. The very great interest
of the question regarding species,
variety, habit, has perhaps led him a little
too wide.</p>

<p class="padtopb">There is one advantage in taking a subject
of this kind, that few professional (literary)
critics can meddle with it, further
than as regards style and language, without
exposing their own ignorance. Yet
will the author experience the highest
pleasure in being instructed and corrected,
wherever his knowledge may be found defective,
or when speculation or misconception
of facts have led him into error. Knowledge
and truth, is mental strength and
health; ignorance and error, weakness and
<span class="xxpn" id="p-vii">{vii}</span>
disease: the man who pursues science for
its own sake, and not for the pride of possession,
will feel more gratitude towards the
surgeon who dislodges a cataract from the
mind’s eye, than towards the one who repairs
the defect of the bodily organ.</p>

<h2 class="h2nobreak" id="p001">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">N<b>AVIGATION</b></span>
is of the first importance to the
improvement and perfecting of the species, in spreading,
by emigration, the superior varieties of man, and
diffusing the arts and sciences over the world; in promoting
industry, by facilitating the transfer of commodity
through numberless channels from where it
is not, to where it is required; and in healing the
products of those most fertile but unwholesome portions
of the earth, to others more congenial to the
existence of the varieties of man susceptible of high
improvement: Water being the general medium of
action,—fluidity or conveyance by water, almost as
necessary to civilized life as it is to organic life, in
bearing the molecules forward in their vital courses,
and in floating the pabulum (the raw material) from
the soil through the living canals to the manufactories
of assimilized matter, and thence to the points
of adaptation. <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span></p>

<p>As civilization progresses under the influence of
navigation, and the earth exchanges her straggling
hordes of savages for enlightened densely-peopled
nations, every climate and country will be more set
apart to its appropriate production, and the utility
of the <i>great conduit, the</i>
<span class="smcap">O<b>CEAN</b></span>, will more and more
be developed, and become the grand theatre of contested
dominion—superiority there being almost
synonymous with <i>Universal Empire</i>—dry land only
the footstool of the <i>Mistress of the
Seas</i><a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnm1">1</a>.</p>

<p>In the still hour which has followed the cannon
roar of our victories, we seem disposed to sleep secure,
almost in forgetfulness, that we possess this
superiority, that we stand forth the Champion of
the World, and must give battle to every aspirant
to the possession of the <i>trident sceptre</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the recent principles of naval motion
and new projectiles, conjoined to shot-proof vessels,
shall have been brought to use in naval warfare,
marine will have acquired a great comparative preponderance
over land batteries, and every shore be
still more at the mercy of the Lords of Ocean.</p>

<p>When we consider the tendency of luxurious
peace, the effeminacy thence flowing in upon many
of our wealthier population,—when we
view, on the <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
one hand, an entailed aristocracy<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnm2">2</a>, whose founders had
been gradually thrown uppermost in more stirring
times, the boldest and the wisest, but whose progeny,
“in a calm world” entailed to listless satiety,
have little left of hope or fear to awaken in them
the dormant energies of their ancestors, or even to
preserve these energies from entirely sinking; and,
on the other hand, an overflowing population, chained,
from the state of society, to incessant toil, the
scope of their mental energies narrowed to a few objects
from the division of labour, all tending to that
mechanical order and tameness incompatible with
liberty; thus, perhaps, equally in danger of deteriorating
and sinking into <i>caste</i>, both classes yielding
to the natural law of restricted adaptation to condition:—when
we reflect on this, the conclusion is
irresistibly <i>forced</i> upon us, that the periodical return
of war is indispensable to the heroic chivalrous
character and love of freedom which we have so long
maintained, and which (Britain being the first in
name and power in the family of nations) must be
so influential on the <i>morale</i> of the civilized world.
It is by the jar and struggle of the conflict that the
baser alloy and rust of our manners and institutions
must be removed and rubbed away: it
is by the <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
ennobling excitement of danger and of hardship that
our generous passions must be cherished, and our
youth led to emulate the Roman in patriotic thirst
for glory—the Spartan in devotion—their own ancestor,
the more daring Scandinavian sea-king or rover<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnm3">3</a>,
in adventurous valour. Without, however, seeking
the fight, yet in preparation for the perhaps not distant
time, when we shall face another foe, it behoves
us, without any sickly sentimentality, to cherish our
warlike virtues—above all things to attend to what
must constitute “the field of our fame,” <i>Our</i> <span class="smcap">M<b>ARINE</b></span>,
and the material of its construction, <i>Naval
Timber</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="h2nobreak" id="p005">PART I. <span class="hsmall">
STRUCTURE OF VESSELS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">V<b>ESSELS</b></span>
are constructed of wood under two
forms, <i>Plank</i> and <i>Timbers</i>; Plank, the out and inside
skin of the vessel—Timbers, the ribs or frame
which support the plank.</p>

<h3>SECTION I. PLANK.</h3>

<p>Trees intended for plank ought to be reared in
close forest, or protected situation, drawn tall and
straight, or what is preferable for a part, with a
gentle regular bend, technically <i>sny</i>, Figs. v and x,
(next page). It requires to be of clean solid texture,
from 12 to 40 feet in length, and at least 8 inches
in diameter at small end, or any greater thickness.
For the conveniency of transport, oak plank timber
is generally squared or planked where grown, and is
cut out from
<span class="nowrap">2 <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>
 to 7 inches in thickness, and from
6 to 18 inches in breadth. Plank is needed of such
various dimensions, that any oak tree of clean timber,
nearly straight one way, and straight, or with
a gentle regular bending, the other, may safely be
cut into plank, the section to be in the
plane of the <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
curve. Figs. v, x, y, z, represent the most advantageous
forms of logs for cutting into plank. The
dotted lines shew the section of the saw in planking:
the straighter the log is in the plane of the saw, it
is the more suitable, as the planks bend sufficiently
<i>side</i>-way by steaming; Fig. v, of considerable bend
and taper, where the planks, when cut, have a bend
<i>edge</i>-way, is the most valuable: this form requires
to be very free of knots. In straight planks, Fig. z,
cleanness from knots is not such a desideratum.</p>
</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i022.png" width="600" height="421" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">
<p>Figs. z, y, of any length—best long; x, from 25 to 35 feet; v, v,
from 12 to 24 feet.</p>

<p>In the above cut, for distinctness, the saw is drawn entering
the butt. In practice it enters the top.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When planks are cut out where grown, they are
sawn from the round log immediately
after it is <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
felled and barked, which not only prevents injury from
drought-cracks, but produces also a considerable
saving of timber and labour, as the wood is softer
when green; and the centre planks can thus be had
much broader than after squaring the log. The outer
part of the matured or red wood, which is partly cut
away in squaring, is also the cleanest for bending.
The sap or not sufficiently matured wood, when left
on the side of the plank in the vessel, wherever it is
not always soaking in water, is only useful to the
shipwright, as it decays in two or three years, and
demands an expensive repair. When plank timber
is squared, it is for the conveniency of carriage and
stowage, and where timber is of little value.</p>

<p>Of British trees suited for plank, the most valuable
are oak, Spanish chesnut, larch, red wood pine,
and sometimes beech<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnm4">4</a>, elm, plane (<i>Acer pseudo-platanus</i>)
under water. As no timber decays under
water for a considerable length of time, when put in
fresh, unless it be devoured by the sea-worm, beech
or any other hard tough wood is nearly equally good
as oak for outside plank under light water-mark,
provided the timber be hastened out of the bush
into the vessel, or be kept in pools, either
in log or <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
plank, till used, or be planked, and the plank kept
dry under cover. One summer on the ground will
generally render a beech log in the bark useless.</p>

<h4 title="DIRECTIONS FOR TRAINING PLANK
TIMBER.">DIRECTIONS<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnm5">5</a>
FOR TRAINING PLANK TIMBER.</h4>

<p>Divide all branches into leaders and feeders; leaders,
the main or superior shoots which tend to become
stems, A, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>; feeders, the inferior branches,
B, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>.</p>

<div class="dctr02">
<img src="images/i024.png" width="600" height="792" alt="" />
<span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
</div>

<p>Should more than one leader appear from the
time of planting the tree till it attain the required
height for the plank, shorten all but the most promising
one down to the condition of feeders, making
the section immediately above a twig, preferring one
which takes a lateral or horizontal direction. Vide
dotted line crossing <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Should any feeder, below the required height, become
enlarged beyond its compeers, such as B, reduce
it to equality (<i>vide</i> dotted line), or prune it close
off, if this should be necessary to the symmetry of
the tree.</p>

<p>Cut off, close by the trunk, all shoots which rise
at a very acute angle with the main stem, such as C.
There is a triple reason for this: they rise up and
interfere with the more regular horizontal feeders,
tending also to become leaders; they do not form a
proper junction with the stem, by reason of the
wood, as it swells, not being able to throw up the
bark out of the narrow angle; thence the bark of
both stem and branch is enclosed in the confined
breek, and the wood never
unites<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnm6">6</a>, thence
disease is <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
liable to be generated between them, or the branches are
subject to be torn down by the wind; and should
they ultimately come to be removed, being then of
considerable size, and the section from their perpendicular
position being partly horizontal, as the sides
of the wound swell up, the rain lodges in the centre,
and generates rot. These nearly perpendicular
branches generally originate from improper pruning,
springing out where a large branch has been cut away.</p>

<p>Lop off all branches, which, by taking an irregular
direction, incline to rub upon the more regular;
also remove all splintered, twisted, and diseased
branches.</p>

<p>Do not cut away any of the lower branches (feeders)
till they become sickly or dead. By pruning
these prematurely, you destroy the fine balance of
nature, and throw too much vigour into the top,
which in consequence puts forth a number of leaders.
You also diminish the growth of the tree by the loss
of healthy feeders; the timber of the tree increasing
in proportion to the quantity of healthy branches
and foliage (the foliage being the
stomach and lungs <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
of the plant). You also, by diminishing the number
of feeders, increase the comparative size of those
remaining, which throws the upper part of the stem
into large knots, improper for plank, and renders
then future excision dangerous, as large feeders,
when circumstance or decay require their removal, or,
when they are rifted off by winds or snow, leave
wounds which often carry corruption into the core
of the tree.</p>

<p>After the tree has acquired a sufficient height of
bole for plank, say from 20 to 60 feet, according to
circumstance of exposure, climate, &amp;c., and also as
many branches above this height as may be thought
necessary to carry on advantageously the vital functions,
as the superior head will now sustain small injury
by being thrown out into large branches and
plurality of leaders, (if it be oak it will become more
valuable by affording a number of small crooks and
knees); it will then be proper, in order to have timber
as clean as possible, and regularly flexible, to
lop clean off all the branches on the stem as far up
as this required height. From the early attention
to procure very numerous feeders, and to prevent
any from attaining large size, the wounds will very
soon be closed over, leaving no external scar, and as
little as possible of internal knot or
breaking off of <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
fibre. There are many salves, panaceæ, and pigments
in use for covering over the section of removed
branches, which in ordinary cases may occasion
no injury, but they are unsightly. In wounds of
beech trees where the cut tubes are so prone to die
downward a considerable way into the stem and to
generate rot, an antiseptic quickly-drying pigment
might be beneficial. This and the time of the season
for pruning, at which the cut tubes or fibres
are least liable to die inward, deserve attention.
We consider the spring the least dangerous time.
Should a number of small shoots spring out in consequence
of this last pruning, they may be swept
down if good plank be desired; if not, they may
remain, as their presence will not greatly injure
the plank, and they occasion the stem to thicken
considerably faster where they grow: yet it is probable
that, in doing this, by obstructing the flow of
the sap downwards, they may interfere with the natural
enlargement of the roots, and ultimately be
injurious. Some varieties, or rather some individuals
of oak, are much more prone to this sprouting
upon the bole after pruning than others; where the
disposition exists in a great degree it ought to be
encouraged, and the tree set apart for the construction
of cabinet work. <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span></p>

<p>This system of pruning—encouraging numerous
feeders and one leader while the tree is young, and
of allowing or rather inducing the branches, after
the tree has acquired sufficient height, to spread out
into a horizontal top, is in harmony with, and only
humouring the natural disposition of trees, and is
therefore both seemly and of easy
practice<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnm7">7</a>. The
perfection of naval forest economy would consist in
superadding (according to instructions to be given
on training of timbers) a top of which every branch
is a valuable bend or knee, though in consequence
of the situation the timber will be fragile, and of
light porous texture.</p>

<p><i>In pruning and educating for plank timber,
the whole art consists in training the tree as much
as possible, and with as little loss of branch as
possible, to one leader and numerous feeders, and
to the regular cone figure which the pine tribe naturally
assumes.</i> This can be best and most easily
performed by timely attention—checking every over-luxuriant,
overshadowing branch and wayward shoot
on its first appearance; so that none of the feeders
which spring forth at first may
be smothered, till <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
they in turn become lowermost; and by the influence
of rather close plantation, which of itself will perform
in a natural manner all that we have been teaching
by art, and will perform it well. This closeness
must, however, be very guardedly employed, and
timeously prevented from proceeding too far, otherwise
the complete ruin of the forest, by premature
decay or winds, may ensue, especially when it consists
of pines. Of course all kinds of pines require
no other attention than this (well-timed thinning),
and to have their sickly moss covered under branches
swept clean down.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>SECTION II. TIMBERS.</h3></div>

<p>Timbers, as before stated, are the ribs of the vessel,
spreading out and upward (excepting at the bow
and stern) at right angles to the keel and keelson,
two large straight logs which form a double spinal
support or backbone. The ribs or compass timbers
in great public building establishments are sometimes
bent by machinery, after being softened by
steam or hot liquids<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnm8">8</a>; and for
this purpose the <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
cleanest straightest wood is requisite. We, however,
do not believe that pieces of great diameter,
bent artificially, can have equal strength and resilience
as when grown bent—the fibre must in some
degree be crippled. We admit that timbers and frames
may be built of separate bended pieces of no great
thickness, and have all the strength and resilience
of natural bend: the strongest and most elastic
mode of forming vessels would be to compose them
of different layers of plank over each other in diagonal
fashion, or at an angle 60°, but the labour and
inconveniency of these modes would be great. We
will not admit that an experiment between the
strength of a piece of coarse cross-grained timber,
half naturally bent, half cut out of the solid, and
that of a piece of clean timber artificially bent, is
any proof on the subject. Let us produce a clean
natural bend, exactly fitted to its place, without any
section of fibre, and make experiment with it. But
at any rate, as this plan (bending of timbers) has
never been adopted to any extent in our private
building-yards, we must
doubt its economy,—either <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
that the practice is of no considerable advantage, or
that the requisite machinery is too expensive for
private establishments, and conclude that fine bent
timber still continues a necessary in the formation
of at least our mercantile marine.</p>

<p>Of the very ingenious innovations in the structure
of vessels contrived by Sir R. <span class="smcap">S<b>EPPINGS</b></span>, by which
knees and crooked timber might nearly be superseded,
we can only say, the practice is not followed, and,
at least in private building-yards, not likely to be so;—that
the demand for fine crooked timber, comparatively,
is, and will continue to be, as great as ever.
Should our war navy, from the introduction of steam
impulse and bomb cannon, be reduced to fleets of
strong gun-boats, the demand for crooked timber,
instead of lessening, will greatly increase,—the building
of frames of straight timber being more expensive,
and less suitable, in small than in large vessels;
and should war occur, in the hurry of the formation
of a new war navy under a different principle, the
speediest and simplest mode of construction will be
followed.</p>

<p>Nearly two-thirds of the timbers of a vessel consist
of the curves and bends <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>; the other
third is of straighter timber,
and easily obtained. <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
All timbers require to be straight in one way—in
the plane of their side, and the sides generally to
be square. The under measures embrace timbers of
appropriate size for vessels from 50 to 500 tons register;
it is seldom that merchantmen are required
under or above this size. Of course, large war-vessels
require timbers of larger dimension. The
corresponding timbers of vessels of different size are
nearly similar figures, and the length of their respective
lines not far from being in the ratio of the
cube root of the tonnage—a little deeper and thicker
in the smaller vessels. When timbers are formed of
larch or pine, they require to be a little more in diameter
than when of oak. <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span></p>

and more when of considerable diameter. Floors are of every rise from
<i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, being flattest at midships, and rising gradually as they
approach the bow and stern. In all timbers, it is necessary, for
strength, that the fibre of the wood extend from one end to the other

not much in use.</p></div><!--dcaption-->

<p>A first foot-hook alternates with each floor, and
second foot-hook, alongside, extending from <i>o</i> to <i>q</i>;
and a top-timber, or third foot-hook, alternates
alongside of each second foot-hook, and chock extending
from <i>q</i> to <i>a</i>. These timbers are bolted together,
and constitute a frame or double rib; and
the skeleton is composed of a series of double ribs
(several inches separate, of course wider above than
lower down, as the timbers decrease in thickness),
to within a little of the bow and stern, where the
timbers are usually placed
singly, without framing. <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
In large vessels a fourth futtock is used; thence
straighter timber is suitable.</p>

<p>The knees occupy the position at <i>x</i>, stretching
horizontally along the inside of the vessel and end
of the beams.</p>

<p>Of British trees, timbers are formed of oak, Spanish
chestnut, larch, red-wood pine, red-wood willow
(the stags-head ozier, <i>Salix fragilis</i>), and sometimes
the broad-leafed elm (<i>Ulmus montana</i>) under water.</p>

<p>In Britain, crooked oak for timbers is found chiefly
in hedge-rows and open forests, where the winds,
casual injury, or overhanging superior branches, have
thrown the tree, while young, from its natural balance;
or, by the tree, from open situation, or excision
of lower branches, parting early into several
leaders, which, in receding from each other, form
curves and angular bends. On the Continent of
Europe, in the natural forest, it is chiefly the tops
of old lofty trees which afford the crooks; in consequence,
those we import are, for the most part, of a
free, light, insufficient
quality<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9" id="fnm9">9</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span></p>

<p>To procure a sufficiency of excellent crooks, every
person who has the charge of young plantations of
timber intended for naval purposes, ought, in the
more exposed situations not favourable to the growth
of plank timber, or timber for bending, when the
plants are from 3 to 15 feet high, to mark out the
most healthy, suitably formed plants, sufficiently
close to fill the ground when of the proper size, say
6 yards apart, and to bend these, as the under
figures will illustrate. The dotted portion is the
growth after being bent.
<span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span></p>

<div class="dctr01" id="idfigf">
<img src="images/i038.png" width="600" height="468" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The bend of floors requiring to be at the middle,
and of angular bend, see
<a href="#idfigf">Fig. <i>f</i></a>, young trees of one-half
the required length, should have the earth removed
from the bulb of the root, from one or both sides,
according to circumstances, and the tree and stool
partially upset to windward, that is, generally south-west;
(the operator, in effecting this, may be assisted
by a strong pronged instrument); then fixed in
this inclined position, and the earth filled in. This
inclination may be given at planting, when the
plants are tall.</p>

<p>The best mode of securing the larger plants in
their bent position, is by rods, forked or hooked at
one end, the other end nailed to a ground-stake;—the
upper end, if forked, firmly tied to the bent
plant by mat or straw rope. Smaller plants may be
secured to the notched tops of stakes by ligatures;
and the smallest, particularly larch, pinned down by
small stakes with hooked tops. Advantage may also
be taken of an adjacent tree of small value, and
which would ultimately be required to be thinned
out, to tie the bended standard down to the most
convenient part of its top or stem, lopping off all
above the ligature, if it interfere with the standard,
and barking it near the ground, to prevent much
future growth. When
the workmen comprehend <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
the required bends, they will fall upon methods of
fixing the plants in the most suitable position, better
adapted to the locality than any directions can
teach. The plants will require to be fixed down at
least two years, and bent a little more than what is
requisite, as in their after-growth they have generally
a tendency to become straighter, from depositing
the thickest layers in the hollow of the bend.
A fine regular curve may be obtained by bending the
plant for several successive years, a little lower every
year; this gradual lowering does not so much check
the growth of the leader, nor tend so much to cause
the feeders upon the upper side to push as leaders.
When oaks are bent, great attention must be paid
to cut away any ground-shoots, and to cut off or
twist down any strong feeders that stand perpendicular
on the upper side of the tree; and also for several
years afterwards, to look over the trees twice
a-year, correcting any exuberant feeder, and destroying
root-shoots. The forester ought to keep in mind
that his pupils are proverbially pliant, and that,
should his growing timber not be of the most valuable
and most appropriate figure, he must rank either
with the negligent or the incapable.</p>

<p>Ship timbers being generally required of greater
depth than thickness, that is, broadest
in the plane <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
of the curve, hedge-row is better adapted to growing
them than the forest, especially when the trees are
close in the row. The bend generally takes place
across the row; and the bole of the tree acquires a
greater diameter in that direction than in the line
of the row. If the figure of the top of a tree be very
elliptical in the horizontal plane, the cross section of
the bole, instead of being circular, will also be elliptical
(cake-grown). The lateral spread of the roots
in thick planted rows being greater than the longitudinal,
also tends to give elliptic bole, the stem
swelling most on the sides where the strongest roots
enter, which, of course, always occurs on the sides affording
most nourishment. Forests intended for
ship timbers might be planted and kept in rows a
considerable distance apart, with the plants close in
the row, and thus acquire the elliptic bole. This
would also facilitate the bending; by being turned
a little right and left alternately, they would spontaneously,
from the weight of the top, and their inclination
to avoid the shade of each other, increase
the original bias. Were forests planted in close
double rows, the plants thick in the row, with wide
avenues or glades between, many of the trees would
acquire crooked boles, and the crooked might be retained
when thinning. Avenues
of this description <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
would form agreeable diversity from the monotonous
irregularity of the forest, and be highly picturesque.</p>

<p>Were close triple rows planted with wide glades
between, having spruce, larch, birch, or other trees
of more rapid growth than the oak in the mid row,
and oak in the side rows, the greater part of the oak
would be thrown out into fine curves by the overshadowing
top of the superior tree. After the oak
had received a sufficient side bias, the central row,
which of those kinds comes soon to be of value, might
be removed.</p>

<p>The easiest way to procure good oak knees is to
look out in hedge-row and open forest for plants which
divide into two or four leaders, from 3 to 10 feet
above ground; and should the leaders not diverge
sufficiently, to train them as horizontally as possible
for several feet, by rods stretching across the top, or
by fixing them down by stakes; see following figures.
Figs. <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>f</i>, are drawn to a smaller scale than <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>;
of course, a stem, after dividing, never extends in
length below the division.</p>

<div class="dctr01"><span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
<img src="images/i041.png" width="600" height="586" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When grown, the main stem, either used whole,
sawn in two, or quartered, will form one wing of the
knee, and the bent branch the other; see figs. <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>.
The dotted lines shew the saw section. Particular
attention must be paid to prevent oaks from separating
into more than four leaders, and also to train
up these leaders a considerable height, without allowing
them to divide again, retaining always numerous
feeders; thus, when the
tree acquires size, <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
many valuable crooks <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, will be formed above
the knees. It is necessary, however, to guard
against training the branches to too great a height,
as, when so, they run much risk of being twisted and
torn by high winds.</p>

<p>Knees may also be obtained by cropping the top
from plants that have side branches similar to <i>f</i>,
and training these branches for leaders as above directed.
In this case, the section, where the top is
cut off, must not be too large, and the branches,
either two or four, well knotted to the trunk, or the
situation sheltered, otherwise the trunk at the section
may be split down by the strain of the wind on
the new leaders. Also, in healthy growing trees of
considerable size, which have spreading tops, and
which are not to be cut down for a considerable time,
the forester, if he have a good eye, may, by lopping
off a few branches here and there throughout the top,
throw the greater part of the boughs into condition
to become knees, or valuable crooks, when of size.
This is of most material consequence to the ultimate
value of half-grown oak trees, in open situations,
and ought to be particularly studied by the
superintendent, as, when allowed to run into very
numerous <i>stemmy</i> branches, without direction or curtailment,
the top, instead of
being ultimately of <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
considerable value as timber, is of none. Directions in
writing will scarcely suffice to teach a forester this
part of his business; he must consider attentively the
knee figures and bends we have furnished, fix them
in his memory, and use every eligible means to obtain
them. Knees, of all descriptions of oak timber
are in the greatest request. We have known them
purchased at 7s. per computed solid foot, which, from
the plan of measuring, is as much as 10s. per real
solid foot. The prevailing inattention to judicious
training will continue to occasion the supply of
knees to be short of the demand, and thence the
price high, provided some change does not take place
in the structure of vessels, or iron knees be adopted,
which are now sometimes used, or vessels, with the
exception of the deck and rigging, be formed of iron
altogether, which we have seen do very well in inland
navigation.</p>

<p>As crooked round oak timber of the natural length
is extremely unmanageable, and its distant transport
very expensive, it is desirable that it be squared and
cut in lengths suited to its ultimate use, where
grown. This requires a thorough knowledge of the
necessary curves, to which the figs.
p. <a href="#p019" title="go to p. 19">19</a>,
will afford
considerable assistance. However, the superintendent
of any extensive fall of naval timber
either should be <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
a shipwright who has had practice in lining off timbers,
or should have passed several months in a dock-yard
during the timbering of vessels, observing every
piece that is put to use.</p>

<p>As most part of the timbers of a vessel have their
sides squared, the cutter cannot err much in hewing
away the sides in the plane of, and at right angles
to, the curves, at least as deep as the sap-wood reaches,
thus leaving only a little sap-wood on the angles;
the sap-wood, in all cases (except in those small craft
used in carrying lime, which preserves from rot),
being worse than useless; by its decay not only
weakening the vessel from the want of entireness of
the timbers, but also acting as a ferment to further
corruption.</p>

<p>In our directions for obtaining curved and angular
bent timbers, we may be thought to have been a
little too minute with the dimensions and figures:
under the hand of the shipwright, or person of
skill, a tree of almost any possible bend cuts out to
valuable purpose: what is wanted is crooked timber,
free of large knots;—first and second foot-hooks
and knees are, however,
most in demand.</p>

Beech, suited for plank, is sometimes of more value when

There are several valuable varieties of apple-trees of
acute branch angle, which do not throw up the hark of the breeks; this
either occasions the branches to split down when loaded with fruit, or,
if they escape this for a few years, the confined bark becomes putrid,
and produces canker, which generally ruins the tree. We have remedied
this by a little attention in assisting the rising of the bark with
the knife. Nature must not be charged with the malformation of these
varieties; at least, had she formed them, as soon as she saw her error
she would have blotted out her work.</p></li>

We are not in possession of sufficient facts to judge of

BRITISH FOREST TREES USED AS NAVAL TIMBER.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">O<b>AK</b></span>—<i>Quercus</i>.</h3>
</div>

<p>Oak appears to be the most prevalent tree about
the middle of the north temperate zone, growing, naturally,
upon almost every soil, excepting some of the
sterile sandy hats. With the exception of the pines,
it is by far the most useful kind of tree, almost balancing
the accommodating figure of stem, and manageable
quality of the pine timber, by its greater
strength and durability, and excelling the pines in
value of bark. It is not easy to determine whether
there be distinct British species in the genus <i>Quercus</i>;
but, at least, there are several breeds, or families, or
grouped resemblances, which, though the individuals
may slightly vary, and though a gradation, or connection,
may be traced among these families themselves,
yet possess general character sufficiently
marked to support names. Botanists, who are so
prompt and so well prepared with
their classes, <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
orders, genera, species, varieties, long before they acquire
much knowledge of what they are so ready to
classify, or be able to distinguish between species and
variety, or know if species and variety be really distinct,
divide the oak of this country into two species,
<i>Quercus Robur</i> and <i>Q. sessiliflora</i>, the former with
long fruit-stalks, and hard, strong, durable timber,
the late leafing old kind once so prevalent in the
island: the latter an earlier leafing, faster growing
kind, timber inferior, leaves petiolate, fruit sessile,
not common, but supposed native. We consider
there is no foundation for this specific distinction;
we have met with oaks with various lengths of
fruit-stalks: Besides, short and long fruit-stalks is
a very common difference among seedling varieties.
The families or breeds which we have observed in
the indigenous oak resemble what are found among
almost every kind of vegetable, and graduate into
each other,—those farthest removed in appearance,
no doubt having power to commix by the pollen.
The most remarkable distinction we have observed
is in the colour of the bark, whether inclining to
white or black. The variety or breed with grey
white bark, often very smooth and shining, and sometimes
beautifully clouded with green, has also a different
form of leaf and figure of top
from those with <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
blackish bark, and we have no doubt will also afford
a different quality of timber. Those with blackish
dingy bark vary considerably from each other, some
being of very luxuriant growth and heavy foliage,
with thick fleshy bark, affording much tannin; others,
though in favourable situation, of stunted growth,
thin dry bark, and delicate constitution, often being
nipped in the twigs by the frost: some having a
round easy figure of top, even with pendulous branching,
others extremely stiff and angular in the
branching; some with the most elegant foliage,
deeply sinuated and finely waved, others with the
clumsiest, most misshapen foliage, almost as if
opposite principles had presided at their forming.
We have observed the earlier kinds, with the dark
bark, to have generally the easiest figure of top; the
angular branching and stiffness of figure of top
being greatest in those sooty-barked late kinds, most
disposed to take two growths in the season, the
spring and autumnal, which, from the proneness of
these kinds to be affected in the terminal bud by monstrosities,
and sometimes also to be nipped in the
point of the unripened autumn shoot by the frost, are
generally thrown out in different directions, the tree,
from these causes, growing awkwardly and irregularly,
and by fits and starts.</p>

<p>Besides the indigenous <i>Quercus
Robur</i>, we have <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
a number of kinds, termed distinct species, growing
in Britain, of foreign derivation—the Turkish oak,
<i>Quercus Cerris</i>; the Lucombe oak, <i>Q. sempervirens</i>;
the scarlet-leaved American, <i>Q. coccinea</i>; the
evergreen, <i>Q. Ilex</i>, and several others. The Turkish
and Lucombe resemble each other, but the latter
generally continues green till the spring, when the
old leaves wither, a little before the young appear:
Botanists make them varieties. We consider the
Turkish oak the most valuable and elegant of these
foreign kinds. The leaves are generally very long
and slender, deeply and widely sinuated, and the
teeth or salient angles sometimes undulated, having
a curled appearance; yet there are some individuals
with broad, short, flat leaves, not differing in figure
from those of the common oak, but the tree in other
respects not different from the Turkish, being easily
distinguished from the common oak by the reddish
hairy appearance of the developing shoot, the scales
of the bud having a hair-like extension, visible in each
leaf axilla. The acorns are also bristled like echini,
with this scaly prolongation. The timber is tough
and clean, resembling the white American, and suitable
for staves. The stem and branches are generally
very straight, as the terminal bud seldom fails,
and the growing proceeds steadily, without much
autumnal shoot. <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span></p>

<p>As oaks run more hazard in transplanting than
most other kinds of trees, the greater care is necessary
in procuring well-rooted, short, vigorous plants;
in having the soil free of stagnating water, in timing
and executing the work in a proper manner, and
in hoeing around the plant, keeping the ground clean
and friable on the surface during the first two or
three seasons. As young oaks grow much more
vigorously under considerable closeness and shelter,
and as the plants are expensive, it is proper to plant,
along with them, a mixture of cheaper plants, larches
or other pines, which also sooner come to be of a
little value, to be removed gradually as the young
wood thickens up. In bleak exposed situations, it
is well to plant the ground first with pines, and when
these attain a height of 6 or 8 feet, to cut out a
number, not in lines, but irregularly, and plant the
oaks in their stead, gradually pruning and thinning
away the remaining firs as the oaks rise. In general,
pitting is preferable to slitting; but when the
plants are very small, and the ground wet-bottomed
(with close subsoil), liable to become <i>honeycomby</i>
with frost, slitting secures the plant better from being
thrown out.</p>

<p>Oak is by far the best adapted tree for hedge-row,
or for being grown by the sides of
arable fields, both <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
with respect to its own qualities, and to the growth
of the adjacent crops or hedge. The bark is much
thicker, and more valuable in proportion to its bulk
here, than in close forest, and the timber more crooked,
which is desiderated in oak, but which unfits
most other trees for much else than firewood. The
oak is, besides, as generally suited for the variety of
soils which lines crossing a country in all directions
must embrace: this is matter of consideration, as few
planters have skill to locate a number of kinds properly.
It will also be thought, by reason of British
feeling, the most interesting and ornamental; nor is
it to be overlooked, that, by the roots taking a more
downward direction than other trees, the plough has
greater liberty to proceed around, and the moisture
and pabulum necessary to evaporation and growth
are not drawn from the ground so superficially;
thence the minor plants adjacent do not suffer so
much. We have observed, too, that, when all cause
of injury by root suction was cut off by a deep ditch,
the undergrowth seemed less injured by shade of
oak than of some other trees. The apple and the
pear only, appear to be as little detrimental to the
surrounding crop as the oak. The ash, the elm, the
beech, in Scotland the most general hedge-row trees,
are the most improperly located; the
ash and the <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
elm as being the most pernicious to the crops, and
the beech as being of little or no value grown in
hedge-row. In clays, most kinds of trees, particularly
those whose roots spread superficially, are more
detrimental to the crop around than in the more friable
earths, owing to the roots in clays foraging at less
depth, and to the clay being a worse conductor of
moisture than other earths. The disadvantages attending
the planting of hedge-row with oaks are, that
their removal is not in general so successful as that
of other trees, especially to this exposed dry situation,
and that the progress of the plant, for a number
of years, is but slow; and thus for a longer time
liable to injury from cattle. Fair success may, however,
be commanded, by previously preparing the
roots, should the plants be of good size; transplanting
them when the ground is neither too moist nor
too dry, and in autumn, as soon as the leaves have
dropped or become brown, particularly in dry ground;
performing the operation with the utmost care not
to fracture the roots, and to retain a considerable
ball; opening pits of considerable size for their reception,
much deeper than the roots, and should a
little water lurk in the bottom of the pit, it will be
highly beneficial, provided none stagnate so high as
the roots; firming the earth well
around the roots <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
after it is carefully shaken in among the fibres;
and, especially, keeping the surface of the ground,
within four feet of the plant, friable and free from
weeds, by repeated hoeings during the first two or
three summers. Of course, if you suffer the plant
to waver with the wind, or to be rubbed and bruised
by cattle, or by the appendages of the plough, it is
folly to expect success. On this account, stout plants,
from 8 to 12 feet high, the branches more out of the
way of injury, may, in sheltered situations, under careful
management, be the most proper size. Much
also depends on procuring sturdy plants from exposed
situations. We have experienced better success with
hardy plants from the exposed side of a hill, having
unfibred <i>carrot</i> roots much injured by removal, than
with others from a sheltered morass, having the most
numerously fibred, well extricated roots. In cases,
where, from the moistness and coldness of the ground
in early summer, there was a torpor of root suction,
and, in consequence, the developing leaves withering
up under an arid atmosphere, we have attempted to
stimulate the root action by application of warm
water, covering up the surface of the ground with dry
litter to confine the heat; we have also endeavoured
to encourage the root action by increasing the temperature
of cold light-coloured soils,
by strewing soot <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
on the surface for a yard or two around the plant,
and by nearly covering a like distance by pieces of
black trap rock, from three to six inches in diameter.
The success from the pieces of trap appeared greatest;
they diminished the evaporation from the ground,
thence less loss of heat and of necessary moisture;
and being at once very receptive of radiant caloric,
and a good conductor, they quickly raised the temperature
of the soil in the first half of the summer,
when bodies, from the increasing power of the sun,
are receiving much more heat by radiation than they
are giving out by radiation.</p>

<p>The oak should never be pruned severely, and
this rule should be particularly observed when the
tree is young. We have known several of the most
intelligent gardener-foresters in Scotland err greatly
in this; and, by exclusively pruning the oak plants,
from misdirected care, throw them far behind the
other kinds of timber with which they were mixed
in planting. There is no other broad-leaved tree
which we have seen suffer so much injury in its
growth, by severe pruning, as the oak. The cause
of this may be something of nervous susceptibility,
or connected life, all the parts participating when
one is injured; it may be owing to the tendency to
putrescency of the sap-wood, or rather of the sap, the
part around the section
often decaying, especially <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
when the plant is not vigorous; or it may arise from
some torpor or restricted connection of the roots,
which, when robbed of their affiliated branch, do not
readily forage or give their foraging to the support of
the nearest remaining branch, or to the general top
of the tree, but throw out a brush of twigs near the
section.</p>

<p>Although the oak often lingers in the growth
while young, yet, after it attains to six inches or a
foot in diameter, its progress is generally faster than
most other kinds of hard wood, not appearing to
suffer so much as others from excessive fruit-bearing.
The value of the timber, and also of the bark, and
the slight comparative injury occasioned to the under
crop, whether of copse, grass, corn, or roots, independently
of any patriotic motives, or religious reverence
lingering in our sensorium from the time of
the Druids, should give a preference to this tree for
planting, wherever the soil and climate are suitable,
over every other kind, with the exception of larch and
willow, which, in particular soils, will pay better.</p>

<p>The planter of oak should throw in a considerable
proportion of Turkish oak into the more favourable
soils and situations. The beautiful clustered, fretted
foliage of this species gives a richness, and, in winter,
when it retains the withered leaf, a warmth of colouring
to our young plantations
beyond any other <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
of our hardy trees and shrubs. We have had this
kind, eighteen years old, equal in size to larches of
the same age in the same ground. We cut down
several of these oaks of about 8 inches in diameter,
and compared the timber and bark with those of
common oak of the same age. The timber was
clean, very tough and flexible, with much <i>flash</i>, and
we should suppose might suit for plank when matured;
at any rate, from the splendid shew of the
laminæ (<i>flash</i>), it would form beautiful pannelling
and furniture. It shrunk, however, extremely while
drying, which must have been partly owing to the
quick growing and youngness, it thence consisting
almost entirely of sap-wood, and this sap-wood almost
entirely of sap; and, when left in the sun in
the round state, after peeling, rent nearly to splinters,—much
more than the common oak under the
same exposure. The bark was about double the
thickness and weight of that of the common oak of
equal size, and, in proportion to its weight, consisted
much more of that cellular or granular substance
most productive of tannin. The varieties of common
oak with thick bark are generally of inferior
quality of timber; but they are by far the finest,
most luxuriant growing trees, with rich heavy foliage,
and appear as giants standing in the
same row with <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
the thin barked varieties, though planted at the
same time.</p>

<p>To the naturalist the oak is an object of peculiar
interest, from the curious phenomena connected with
the economy of numerous insects who depend upon
it for existence. It would be tedious to describe the
different apples, galls, excrescences, tufts, and other
monstrosities which appear upon the oak. It is
something like enchantment! These insects, merely
by a puncture and the deposition of an egg, or drop
of fluid, turning Nature from her law, and compelling
the Genius of the Oak to construct of living organized
oak matter, instead of leaves and twigs,
fairy domes and temples, in which their embryo
young may lie for a time enshrined.</p>

<span class="smcap">C<b>HESTNUT</b></span>—<i>Castanea vulgaris</i>,
<span class="nowrap">(<i>Fagus Castanea, L.</i>)</span></h3></div>

<p>Spanish or sweet Chestnut, sometimes named
Chestnut Oak, sometimes included in the genus Fagus,
seems at least a connecting link between Quercus
and Fagus. This valuable timber tree, the largest
growing, and, in many places, also the most common
in the south of Europe, and which was
once so <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
abundant in England that many of the largest of our
ancient piles are wooded of it, has been for several
ages much on the decrease in this country; owing,
probably, to a slight refrigeration of climate, which,
during this period, appears to have taken place, preventing
the ripening of the seed, or, in more rigorous
winters, following damp, cold summers, destroying
all the young plants (at least the part above
ground), whose succulent unripened shoots and more
delicate general constitution, from immatured annual
round of life, or imperfect concoction of juices, have
not power to withstand the severe cold sometimes
occurring near the surface of the earth. A very general
destruction of the young plants of this kind of
tree has occurred more than once within our memory
from severe frost; but as the climate, a few
years back, rather improved, and the spirit of planting
became more general, a considerable number of
plants of this tree have attained height and hardihood
to withstand the cold, excepting in the points
of the annual shoot, which we notice are again nipped
(year 1830). This may give encouragement to
more extended planting, as the tree is handsome,
and, in most places, where water does not abound
nor stagnate, acquires great size in comparatively
short time. It is said to prefer a
gravelly or stone <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
rubble subsoil, but we have seen it in rich clay, in
row with large beeches, even exceed them in size.
We should prefer for it any deep friable dry soil.</p>

<p>There is one circumstance connected with this
timber in this country, at least in Scotland, which
must prevent its general use in ship plank, and be
of material injury to it for ship timbers; this is,
that few trees of it of size are found without the
timber being shaky or split, some to such a degree
that the annual rings or concentric growths have separated
from each other. This appears to be owing
to our climate being colder than what is suitable to
the nature of the plant; the sap in the stem possibly
freezing in severe weather and splitting, or severing
the growths of the timber, but more probably
occasioned by the season being too short, and too
moist and cold, to ripen or fill up with dense matter,
sufficiently, the frame of the annual growths; thence,
as each ring of sap-wood, prematurely hastened by
the torpor of moisture and cold, turns to red or matured
wood, and, in so doing, dries considerably
within the other rings of moist sap-wood, the contractile
force may be sufficient to separate this growth
from the next external sap growth, the cohesion existing
between the tissue or fabric of the growth
being much stronger than the
cohesion between one <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
growth and another. The uncommon dryness of
the matured wood, and moistness of the sap-wood of
this tree, and smallness of the number of sap-wood
rings, commonly only from 2 to 6 in this country,
incline us to believe that this is the cause of the insufficiency
or defect; and that, in a milder, drier climate,
the sap-wood rings will be found to be more
numerous, and thus, independent of a better first
ripening, affording a longer time for their cells to be
more filled up with an unctuous matter (which prevents
the shrinking) gradually deposited while they
convey the sap, the sap-wood rings being the part of
the timber through which the sap circulates. As
proof of this unctuous deposit or filling up, we observe
that dry sap-wood imbibes moisture much
quicker, and in greater quantity, than dry mature.
We think this premature maturity (if we may so
term it) of timber in cold countries, a general law.
Our larch, originally from the Apennine, has not
more than one-third of the number of sap-rings of
our Scots fir, indigenous in Mar and Rannoch
mountains; and our narrow-leafed, or English elm,
said to have been introduced from the Holy Land
in time of the Crusades, has not more than one-half
of the number of our indigenous broad-leafed, or
Scots elm. From the
sap-growths of Laburnum, <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
scarcely exceeding in number those of the Spanish
chestnut, we should suppose that it has been moved
northward, or that the proper climate has left it.
We have observed that moist, or water-soaked
ground, has influence, as well as climate, to deprive
the alburnum vessels sooner of their living functions,
inducing that torpor of tubes, or semi-vital condition,
in which they only serve to support the more
active parts, and constitute what is called Mature
Timber.</p>

<p>It is a general opinion that Spanish chestnut soon
takes rot in situations where the roots come in contact
with water. This appears to result from moist
soil inducing the too early maturing of the timber
already alluded to, and occasioning shaky insufficient
fabric, which soon corrupts. We have observed oaks
which had fewer layers of sap-wood, from growing in
damp situations, have the timber of inferior quality,
and sometimes of a shaky, brownish description,
when cut across, throwing out a dirty brownish liquid
or stain.</p>

<p>From the use of the Spanish chestnut in the
Spanish navy, both in planking and timbering, and
from the roofing beams and ornamental work of
Westminster Hall being also of this wood, we should
suppose it was not so liable to this defect
of rents in <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
the timber in milder climates. Chestnut timber is a
good deal similar to oak, though not quite so reedy and
elastic, but is destitute of the large laminæ or plates
(<i>flash</i>), which, radiating from the pith to the outside,
become so prominent to view in the oak when
the longitudinal section is perpendicular to the outside,
in the plane of the laminæ. It is, we should
think, as capable of supporting weight, when stretching
as a beam, as the oak, and is equally, if not
more durable, many beams of it existing in very old
buildings undecayed: it is said even to have been
taken out fresh where it had stood 600 years as
lintels. Earth stakes of it are also very durable.
It possesses one advantage over oak, which must recommend
it for ship-building, that is, having much
less proportion of sap-wood; and, from the matured
wood containing much less sap or moisture, we should
suppose it not so liable to dry rot, or that more
simple means, or shorter period, would suffice for
seasoning it, so as to be proof against this evil. Spanish
chestnut is as yet little known among British
shipwrights; but were a quantity of it in the market
free of the unsoundness we have alluded to,
its merits would soon become known. The bark is
used by tanners, but is said not to equal
that of oak.</p>

<h3 id="p048">
<span class="smcap">B<b>EECH</b>-T<b>REE</b></span>—<i>Fagus
sylvatica</i>.</h3></div>

<p>This hardy tree occupies fully as wide a range,
both of soil and climate, as the oak, and is generally
the fastest growing, most vigorous of all our hard-wood
kinds, prospering on all soils, on the dry and
moist, the aluminous, the calcareous, the siliceous,
provided water does not stagnate. It combines magnificence
with beauty, being at once the Hercules
and Adonis of our Sylva. The timber of our beech,
while green, is by far the hardest of our large growing
trees, and, in the American forest, the members
of the beechen family match better than those of any
other, with the perseverance of the ruthless Yankee;
the roots retaining the hardness deeper in the earth
than those of any other tree, and being so plaited and
netted throughout the ground for a considerable
space around the bulb, that it is next to impossible
to trench or dig over the soil till they have decayed.</p>

<p>As we have before stated, the timber of the beech-tree
soon corrupts if it is not speedily dried, or kept
in water after being cut down, and is equally liable
to corruption in the tree when deprived of life by
wounds or other injury. Beech has a matured and
sap wood, although they are not very distinguishable,
being nearly of one colour. The
former has <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
considerable durability when kept dry, the latter is speedily
consumed by worming.</p>

<p>The planter of beech should procure the
kind<a class="afnanc" href="#fn10" id="fnm10">10</a>
with yellow-coloured wood, termed by joiners Yellow
Beech, in opposition to the kind with white wood,
called White Beech. The yellow grows faster and
straighter, and is cleaner and freer of black knots,
and also more pleasantly worked than the white, but
it corrupts much sooner in the bark when cut down.
This variety of beech, when properly trained, is probably
the most profitable hard-wood that we can
raise; when planked, it bends pleasantly under the
shipwright to the curvature of the vessel’s side. The
tree is also much superior in size and grace of outline
to the white. There are few planters who need
be put in mind that beech of small size, or of short or
crooked stem, is the least valuable of all timber.
Whoever plants with a view to profit will, therefore,
throw in only as many beech plants as may ultimately
be required for standards, and these in the bosom
of plantations; as it is seldom that beech attains to
much value in hedge-row or on the
outskirts of woods, <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
from its proneness when so situated to ramify and
grow crooked. It is, however, quite possible, with a
little early attention, to rear beech as straight and
clean as to be valuable, on the outskirts, where it forms
a beautiful fringe to the plantation, and affords excellent
shelter.</p>

<p>This beautiful and most graceful tree, whose
favourite locality is the damp, deep, accumulated
soil, free of stagnant water, at the bottom of declivities,
is, together with its sister, the small-leaved
kind, the English elm, when so situated, the
fastest growing of our hard-wood trees. Both delight
in easy or gravelly soils, though the small-leaved
will also prosper in the more adhesive, the alluvial
and diluvial clays.</p>

<p>There are a number of kinds of elm growing in
this country, differing rather more from the common
run of <i>U. montana</i> and <i>U. campestris</i>, than what occurs
among seedling varieties of untamed plants; but
as these have very probably a power of mingling by
the pollen, thence not specifically different,
we leave to <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
botanists to explain their nice peculiarities, and think
it sufficient to rank the whole under <i>montana</i> and
<i>campestris</i>, especially as the timber seems to range
into two kinds—<i>Montana</i>, with large leaves, heavy
annual shoots, somewhat zig-zag, thick towards the
point, thence drooping a little from gravity; having
much sap-wood, and timber of great longitudinal
toughness, but, from the great quantity of sap-wood,
and want of lateral adhesion, it splits considerably in
drying;—<i>Campestris</i>, with smaller leaves, more
numerous straight annual shoots, which are small towards
the point, thence more erect, has but little sap-wood,
and the timber also possessing greater lateral
adhesion, and less longitudinal, it does not crack
much in drying. We have noticed one broad leaved
kind or variety, whose annual twigs often spring out
in tufts or knots from one point; this seems to arise
from the shoot of the preceding year sometimes dying,
probably nipped by frost, and the tuft of shoots
springing out from the knot at the lower extremity
of the dead twig. From this cause, it has not the
graceful easy spread of branches of the <i>U. montana</i>,
but assumes a more angular, stiff, upright figure.
We have heard this named Dutch Elm, but it does
not quite correspond with the elm in the parks at
London said to be Dutch. We consider
it a kind <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
not very nearly allied to <i>U. montana</i>, yet the above
peculiarity of appearance may only arise from individual
tenderness, and may not be accompanied by
other difference of character.</p>

<p>The elm, more especially the broad-leaved Scotch
elm, has a peculiar fan-like sloping-to-one-side spread
of branches, most perceptible while young; hence
the tree when grown up, has generally a slight bending
in the stem, which renders it very fitting for
floor-timbers of vessels, the only part of a ship, excepting
bottom plank, to which it is applicable, as it
soon decays above water. Its great toughness and
strength, however, render it good floors.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of foreign elm which deserve
attention. Some time ago we planted several
of these, and lately cut down one of about six inches
diameter, which we found a great deal harder and
stronger timber than our <i>U. montana</i>. We had
this kind under the name of the Broad-leaved American.
The bark was rather lighter in colour, and
smoother, than <i>U. montana</i>; the leaves were rough
and large, and the annual shoots extremely luxuriant;
but, probably owing to climate, or difference of
circumstance, the exposed situation where we had it
growing being very unlike the close American forest,
it did not carry up its vigour
of growing into <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
the top, although the top was healthy, but continued
throwing out numerous annual shoots, five or
six feet long, from the bulb and side of stem, which
disposition we did not succeed in correcting by pruning.
This did not seem to arise from grafting, as
some of the shoots broke out higher up than the graft
must have been, and there was no difference between
the lower and upper shoots.</p>

<p><i>U. montana</i>, when come to some size, on the
primary branches being lopped off, like the oak, often
throws out a brush of twigs from the stem, and
these twigs impeding the transit of the sap, the brush
increases, and the stem thickens considerably, in consequence
of a warty-like deposit of wood forming at
the root of the twigs. This excrescence, when of
size, after being carefully seasoned in some cool moist
place, such as the north re-entering angle of a building,
exposed to the chipping from the roof, forms a
richer veneer for cabinet-work than any other timber.
This disposition to form brush and excrescence
might be given by art to almost any kind of tree,
excepting the coniferæ and beech, and might be
made a source of considerable profit. This could
easily be effected by slitting, pricking, and bruising
the bark at certain periods of the season. A very
beautiful waved timber might also
be formed by <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
twisting the stems of trees tight up with round ropes,
the screw circles of the rope not being quite close to
each other; the ropes to remain several seasons, then
to be kept off for a season or two, and again applied.
The practice of forming warty excrescences might
be combined with that of forming wavy fibres, with
the finest effect. Of course, those trees with timber
of rich colour, and susceptible of high polish, would
be the most suitable for undergoing this process.
<i>U. campestris</i> also throws out a brush, but from the
great inferiority of the timber in beauty, and from
its unfitness for cabinet-work, it would be useless to
encourage it by art. Some plants of <i>montana</i>, not
covered with brush, have a curious unevenness (laced
appearance) of the timber in the stem, which renders
it a beautiful cabinet plank.</p>

of living narrow-leaved elm-trees, which the
perseverance of the peasantry in quest of billets, has
reduced to this condition. Some varieties of this
elm, however, when uncurtailed in lateral expansion,
attain the grandest development, stretching forth a
hundred giant arms aloft, supporting masses of foliage,
fantastically magnificent.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of London, this tree is attacked
by an insect, which, running along the outside
of the timber, within the bark, in a few seasons
deprives the individual of life, the bark peeling
off in large girdles, threatening to bereave this capital
of the finest ornaments of its parks. We have
observed, in different kinds of growing trees, such as
the apple and oak, the roads of insects traversing between
the rhind and wood, although the individual
thus affected appeared to suffer little or no injury; and
we consider the agency of the insect in the destruction
of the English elm around London to be merely
sequent to disease—perhaps a taint of corruption,
or slight putrescency of the sap, occasioned by the
<i>impurities of the London air</i>, assisted by the hard
beaten state of the ground<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnm11">11</a> above
the roots. Should <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
any one examine the inside of the bark of a cut tree,
when corruption has just begun with the bark, and
see how thoroughly it is undermined by insects, he
will, we think, admit the strong probability, that the
insect is only subordinate in the destruction of those
fine old elms around London. We do not wonder
at the condition of the trees—it would not surprise
us if the human race in London were swept off by
some similar secondary cause.</p>

<p>The small-leaved elm has great disposition to
spread by suckers from the roots, and thus extended
has become very prevalent throughout most parts of
England, in the broad wastes (termed fences), which,
from the indolent husbandry, consequent to tithes
and the want of leases, generally surround the pasture
and corn fields, but which are so necessary to
these unvaried plains, as some prominent object, or
characteristic land-mark, on which the <i>amor patriæ</i>
of the population may perch; the finest remembrances
and associations of youth being mixed up
with these bushy flower-covered enclosures.</p>

<p>It is with country as with society, strong lasting <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
attachment occurs only where there is individuality
of character to give distinctness of image.</p>

<div class="dctr02 fsz6">
<p><span class="spqut">“</span>Oh! how should I my true love know,</p>
<p><span class="spqut">&#x2008;</span>From many other one?”</p>
</div><!--dctr02-->

<p>There is design and utility in this fascination
of peculiarity. If individual distinction be but
strongly marked, it signifies little of what character.
Love of country often hangs upon features of the
harshest and most fearful description, with which the
associations and feelings become entwisted, as attachment
to individual is often rivetted by fierce, austere,
or even morose qualities.</p>

<p>The narrow-leaved elm is valuable for forming the
blocks and dead-eyes<a class="afnanc" href="#fn12" id="fnm12">12</a>, and other wooden furniture
of rigging, being particularly suitable for these purposes,
from its hard and adhesive nature, and indisposition
to crack or split, when exposed to sun and
weather.</p>

<p>We have observed many minor distinctions, perhaps
individual, in the above kinds of elm, in figure,
size and smoothness of leaf, in colour and roughness <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
of bark, &amp;c. Some varieties or individuals of the
English elm have the bark of the young twigs and
branches covered with corky ridges: others want this
excrescence.</p>

<span class="smcap">O<b>ZIER</b></span>,—<i>Salix
fragilis</i><a class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnm13">13</a>.
</h3></div>

<p>This kind of willow, once very common in the
alluvial parts of Scotland, before the introduction of
<i>Salix alba</i>, <i>S. Russelliana</i>, &amp;c., is probably the
most profitable timber that can be planted in such
soils. It was our district’s maxim, that “the willow
will purchase the horse before any other timber
purchase the saddle,” on account of its very quick
growth, and the value of its timber. It delights in <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
the rich easy clay by the sides of our <i>pows</i> (the old
Scottish term for those sluggish natural drains of
our alluvial districts), throwing out its fibril roots
in matted-like abundance under the water: it also
flourishes in the more sandy and gravelly alluvion,
by the sides of rivers and streams, which does not
become too dry in summer.</p>

<p>This tree, similar to some others which, like it, are
continued by cuttings or layers, is, in certain seasons,
especially when of considerable size, subject to
a derangement in the sap-concoction, which leads
to the death of some of its more recent parts, particularly
the uppermost branches; whence its withered
top sometimes assumes the appearance of a stag’s
head of horns, which, from the indestructibility of
these dead branches, it retains for many years; new
branches springing out from the sides, of much luxuriance.
This disease, similar to canker in the genus
Pyrus, is generally concentrated to certain places of
the bark and alburnum, the portion of branch above
these places thence withering, the connection with
the root being cut off; though sometimes the points
of the twigs appear to be nipped, without any previous
disease. From these affections, and also on
account of the branches and stem being often rifted
by the winds, the tree is frequently
found with rot <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
in the stem, when it has stood long. It agrees in
this with the larch, that, though its timber, when cut
down, or withered and dried, as on the top of the
tree, is little liable to corruption, yet it is very subject
to it, as part of the stem of the living tree, perhaps
under certain circumstances of semi-vitality.
To determine whether this tree, raised from seed,
would be liable to these disorders, the same as when
continued by slips, would be an interesting, though
tedious, experiment. We never have seen any young
seed-plants rise around old trees.</p>

<p>The use of the red wood willow, as timbers of
vessels, has been of long standing in this part of
Scotland, and has proved its long endurance, and
excellent adaptation. By reason of its lightness,
pliancy, elasticity, and toughness, it is, we think, the
best, without exception, for the formation of small
fast-sailing war-vessels. We are pretty certain that
our Navy Board would not have cause to regret trial
of it in a long, low, sharp schooner, of sufficient
breadth to stand up under great press of sail, moulded
as much as possible to combine great stability
with small resistance from the water, and when in
quick motion to be buoyant—especially not to dip
forward,—provided it could be procured not too old,
and free from rot, large knots, and
cross-grain; a very <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
little attention in the cultivation would afford it of the
finest bends, and clean and fresh. Our Navy Board
have received some slight teaching from our transatlantic
brethren, of the superior sailing of fir-constructed
vessels, to those of oak, the result of their
superior lightness, pliancy, and elasticity.</p>

<p>The writer of this has also had experience of two
vessels, one of oak, and the other of larch, on the
same voyages, at the same time, and has found the
latter superior in sailing to the former, in a degree
greater than the difference of build could account
for. From the superior elasticity and lightness of
the willow, even to larch, the lightest and most elastic
of the fir-tribe, we should expect that vessels of
it would outstrip those of fir, at least of Scots or red
pine, as much as the latter do those of oak; and
that, from this greater elasticity and lightness, they
would move through the water, yielding to the resistance
and percussions of the waves, compared to
those of oak, as a thing of life to a dead block. For
vessel-timbers, this wood requires to be used alone;
as, when mixed with other kinds less pliant or elastic,
the latter have to withstand nearly all the impetus
or strain, and are thence liable to be broken,
or from the vessel yielding more at one place than
another, she is apt to strain
and become leaky. <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span></p>

<p>Some years ago, when demolishing an old building
which had stood fully a century, the writer
found the large frames of the building, or ground
<i>couples</i>, which, from their situation, could not have
been renewed, to consist of this timber; and, with
the exception of the outside, which was so much
decayed, for about half an inch in depth, as the
finger could pick it away, the body of the wood was
as fresh as at first, still fit for any purpose, and of a
beautiful pink or salmon colour. When we observed
the mouldering exterior of these pieces, we laid one
of the smallest hollow over a log, and struck it with
a large wooden mallet, not doubting that it would
go to fragments; such, however, was the <i>resilience</i>,
that the mallet rebounded so greatly as almost to
leap from our hands.</p>

<p>For country purposes, red-wood willow is employed
in the construction of mill water-wheels, of
the body or hoarding of carts, especially of lining of
carts employed in the carriage of stones, or of any
utensil requiring strong, tough, light, durable boarding.
Formerly, before the introduction of iron-hoops
for cart-wheels, the external rim or felloe was made
of willow; when new, the cart or wain was driven
along a road covered with hard small gravel (in preference,
gravel somewhat angular),
by which means <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
the felloe shod itself with stone, and thus became
capable of enduring the friction of the road for a
long time, the toughness and elasticity of the willow
retaining the gravel till the stone was worn away.
Under much exposure to blows and friction, this
willow outlasts every other home timber. When
recently cut, the matured wood is slightly reddish,
and the sap-wood white. When exposed to the air
and gradually dried, both are of salmon colour, and
scarcely distinguishable from each other. Willow-bark
is used in tanning; it also contains a bitter,
said to be febrifuge.</p>

<p>Very little observation will distinguish these from
the next useful great tribe of the Coniferæ with
white wood, the Spruces and Silver Firs—Abies.</p>

<p>There are a number of foreign kinds of pine, some
of great promise, recently introduced into Britain,
but of whose adaptation for ship-building we cannot
speak. Samples of the timber of <i>P. laricio</i>, <i>P.
tæda</i>, <i>P. cembra</i>, <i>P. maritima</i>, <i>P. rigida</i>, &amp;c. of
British growth, may, however, soon be had of sufficient
size for experiment. The common Scots fir
is the only pine of British growth which has been
employed as a naval timber; for which purpose,
however, since the last peace, and the introduction
of our larch, it is in very little demand.</p>

<p>An acute botanist, Mr G. Don of Forfar, a number
of years ago, gave a description of the varieties
of cultivated Scots fir which had come under his notice.
The following is an abstract of his observations: <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span></p>

<blockquote>

<div>“<i>Varieties of Pinus sylvestris.</i></div>

<p>“Var. 1st. The common variety, well known by
its branches forming a pyramidal head, the leaves
marginated, of dark-green colour, but little glaucous
underneath, the cones being considerably elongated
and tapering to the point, and the bark of the trunk
very rugged. This variety seems short-lived, becoming
soon stunted in appearance.</p>

<p>“Var. 2d, Distinguishable from the former by
disposition of branches, which are remarkable for horizontal
disposition and tendency to bend downwards
close to the trunk. The leaves are broader
than var. 1st, and serrulated, not marginated;
leaves are distinguishable at a distance by their
much lighter and beautiful glaucous colour, the bark
not so rugged as var. 1st, and the cones thicker and
not so much pointed, and also smoother. This tree
seems a hardy plant, growing freely in many soils:
this variety may be named Pinus horizontalis. Var.
1st, much more general than var. 2d, and also sooner
comes to seed, which is also easier gathered from the
position of the branches.</p>

<p>“Var. 3d, Is of a still lighter colour than var. 2d,
being of a light glaucous hue, approaching to a silvery
tint; its branches form, like var. 1st, a pyramidal
head, but it differs remarkably in
its cones from <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
both the former varieties; the cones of this seem beset
with blunt prickles bent backwards, the leaves
serrulated. This variety is rather more common
than var. 2d; like it, it is a good tree.</p>

<p>“Var. 4th, The leaves somewhat curled or rather
twisted, and much shorter than the others: this variety
is very rare.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Our observation does not go to confirm these subdivisions.
We think they are little more distinct
than the fair, the red<a class="afnanc" href="#fn15" id="fnm15">15</a>, the black haired, the fair,
the sallow, the brown complexioned, the tall, the
short, of the same community or even family of men.
There is variation and individuality more or less
strongly marked in all kinds of organized beings:
at least those vegetables which have exposed fructification
possess it; many whose fructification is secluded
also possess it; and the others of more constant
character, such as some of the Gramineæ, with
a little art (removing their anthers before the
pollen bursts forth, and applying the pollen of
others as near to them in the chain of life as can
be found to be different, or changing the circumstances
by culture), can also be
rendered equally <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
variable. These minor distinctions or individualities of
vegetables become more perceptible as our observation
closes in upon the object. We have never yet
found one individual apple plant, raised from seed,
to be the counterpart of another; but differing even
in every part and habit, in bud, leaf, flower, fruit,
seed, bark, wood, root; in luxuriance of growth; in
hardihood; in being suited for different soils and climates,
some thriving in the very moist, others only
in the dry; in the disposition of the branches, erect,
pendulous, horizontal; in earliness and comparative
earliness of leaf, of flower, of fruit.</p>

<p>We hope the above remarks will not be lost on
those who have the management of the sowing,
planting, and thinning of woods, and that they will
always have selection in view. Although numerous
varieties are derived from the seed of one tree, yet
if that tree be of a good <i>breed</i>, the chances are
greatly in favour of this progeny being also good.
Scots fir of good variety will thrive and reach considerable
size and age, in almost any soil which is not
very moist, or very arid and barren (such as our sand
and gravel flats much impregnated with iron or
other deleterious mineral), provided the plants from
their earliest years have room to throw out and retain
a sufficiency of side branches. This is especially
necessary to their health where the
soil is <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
ungenial, the resulting vigour often overcoming the disadvantages.
From the pine being found chiefly in
the light sandy districts on the continent of Europe,
and in the sandy pine barrens of America, an idea
has gone abroad that these barren districts are more
congenial to it than the more clayey, the more rocky,
or the richer vegetable mould; but its natural location
in the barren sandy districts results from its being
more powerful in this soil than any other plant of the
country, not from preference of this soil. Should
any one doubt of this, let him take a summer excursion
to Mar Forest, where no other tree having been
in competition with Pinus sylvestris, and where it is
spread over the hill and the dale, he will observe
that it prospers best in good timber soil, and though
comparatively preferring an easy soil, and having superior
adaptation to thin or rocky ground, that its
taste does not differ very materially from that of the
plane or the elm, the oak or the ash.</p>

<p>In Mar Forest he will also observe (if they be not
now all cut down) several well marked individuals
of the <i>splatch</i> pine, esteemed a very valuable and
hardy kind; and with the right which a botanist has
in a plant sown by nature, he may bear off some of
the seeds, and endeavour to spread this rare indigenous
kind throughout the island. Should he be
unsuccessful in finding these at Mar,
he may return <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
by Kenmore, where, on the side of the hill on the
right bank of the Tay, near the confluence of the
Lyon, he will find several trees, we think five, of
this kind of pine, of considerable size, growing at one
place, apparently planted: we were told the plants
had been brought down from the natural forest farther
up on the mountains. These are sufficiently
distinct in character from the common Scots fir
growing around, having a horizontal, straggling disposition
of branches, the leaves being of a much
lighter, different shade of green, and more tufted,
and the bark of a yellower red, so as to merit a distinct
name; and we should consider Pinus horizontalis
as descriptive as any other, if it shall not appear to
be only a sub-species of P. sylvestris. The descriptive
name <i>splatch</i> fir, is from the prominences of the
rugged bark not being in longitudinal ridges or
flutes, but in detached flat oblong lumps, such as
soft clay or mud takes when cast with force upon a
wall. We, however, do not think this the same as
Mr <span class="smcap">D<b>ON</b></span>’s var.
2d, at least we have noticed in our
lowland woods raised by planting, such as Mr <span class="smcap">D<b>ON</b></span>
examined, individuals here and there having less or
more resemblance to his described varieties, but none
of them approaching the distinctness of this alpine
Scots fir. The proprietors of this kind of pine will
confer a benefit on the public by
causing the timber <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
be examined and compared with that of trees of
equal size of the common Scots fir growing near,
and making a public report of the number and size
of annual growths, the number of these of matured
and of sap wood, the comparative strength, density,
quantity of resinous deposit, hardness, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Pinaster is a valuable kind of red-wood
pine, with strong resinous timber, and from not having
one-half the number of sap-wood layers of the
common Scots fir, we should consider it deserving
attention as a naval timber; but perhaps the small
number of sap-layers is from want of climate: owing
to the branches being larger, and, in proportion to
their size, being joined to the stem with a larger
swell than those of P. sylvestris, the timber is
rougher with larger knots. In the very barren sand
and gravel district near Christchurch, scarcely affording
sustenance to lichens, and where even heaths
will not grow, we have observed this tree make considerable
progress, and outstrip the Scots fir in
growth.</p>

<p>The Canadian Red Pine has been employed to a
considerable extent in this country, both as planking
and spars. It is inferior in strength and durability
to the Baltic red pine, and would seldom
make its appearance on this side the Atlantic while
the Baltic was open to us, did not a
very ill advised <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
duty obstruct the supply of the better article. This
timber is sometimes supplied with a good character
by the shipwright, as it is soft, pliant, and easily
worked. The Canadian red pine has a greater
number of layers of sap-wood than any other red
pine we are acquainted with; we have repeatedly
counted 100 sap-wood layers. We have never seen
this kind of pine growing in Britain.</p>

<p>The most common American pine, with yellow
timber, Pinus strobus, has been introduced for a
long time back into Britain, it is said first by the
Earl of Weymouth, thence sometimes named Weymouth
Pine. This rather elegant tree requires a
warm sheltered situation, as it is easily torn down
by wind, from the weakness of the timber, which is
inferior in hardness and strength to any other pine we
are acquainted with; and from its slender needle
leaf not having substance to withstand the evaporation
of much exposure. Altogether, the kind appears
rather out of climate in Britain, and, though the
monarch of the pines in Canada, holds here but a very
subordinate place. Although extremely tender and
light, the matured timber does not soon decay when
cut out thin and exposed to wind and weather, nor
worm when kept dry in houses; but when employed
in shipbuilding,—remaining always
between the moist <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
and dry, the condition most favourable to putrefaction,
and surrounded by a close, warm, putrid atmosphere,—it
very soon, especially in masses, becomes
corrupted. It requires more time to season or dry
in the deal than any other wood, owing to the fineness
of fibre, smallness of pores, and want of density.
From this quality of parting with its moisture with
extreme slowness, it forms convenient deck-planking
for vessels on tropical stations, or when employed in
carriage of unslacked lime, as the plank does not
readily shrink and become leaky under the great evaporation
occasioned by the heat and arid air. Yellow
pine has generally about 40 growths of sap-wood.</p>

<p>We have had no acquaintance with American
pitch pine as a growing tree. As a timber, it is superior
in several respects to all the others, having
a great deal more resinous matter, so much, as
often to render it semitranslucent. It is strong and
weighty, and is used as a naval timber for most of
the purposes to which other pine timber is applied.
It forms the very best bottom planking. The shipwrights
of the docks at Devonport will attest its
quality, as the bottom planking of the Gibraltar of
80 guns: this vessel carried home to England from
the Mediterranean, a piece of coral rock of about ten
tons weight sticking in her
bottom, her preservation <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
in all probability resulting from the adhesive quality
of this timber. Its great weight is, however, a considerable
inconveniency attending its use as spars,
and the abundance of resin, we should think, would
unfit it for tree-nails; resinous tree-nails,—probably
from some derangement of the structure or disposition
to chemical change produced in the resin by the
very great pressure of the hard driving,—soon corrupting
and infecting the adjacent wood. In some
cases we have also known very resinous Baltic plank
decay soon in vessels. The pitch pine, from the quantity
of resin, contracts little in drying, at least for a
long time, till the resin itself begins to dry up. It
forms the best house-floors we have seen, being strong
and durable, continuing close at joinings, and the
fibre not readily taking in moisture when washed.</p>

<p>Our red-wood pine, when come to some age, is in
wet ground attacked by rot, which commences in
the bulb and adjacent roots and stem, in a manner
very similar to the rot in larch. The red-wood also
approaches nearer to the outside where this rot exists,
and on the side of the tree where the rot is
greatest. Most of our planted red pine forest, especially
in poor wet tills, and in all flat sandy moorish
ground of close subsoil, fall by decay at from 30 to
60 years old. This decay is gradual,
owing to the <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
difference in strength of constitution of the individuals.
Closeness of rearing and consequent tall
nakedness of stem, and disproportion of leaves to
stem, would alone induce this in a few years longer
even in good soil, excepting perhaps in protected
narrow dells; but the decay commences much sooner
when the soil is unfavourable, and is no doubt accelerated
by the mode of extracting the seeds by kiln-drying
the cones, and by using a weak variety of the
plant. The approach of this decay may often be noticed,
several years previous, in the saw-cross section
of the stem mid-way up the tree—an irregular portion
of the section appearing of a different shade,
from breaking off free and irregular before the teeth
of the saw, and not having so much fibrous cover as
the healthy part. When Scots fir rises naturally,
it is not nearly so subject to this decay even in very
inferior soils: the plants having generally much more
room from the first, do not rise so tall, have more
branch in proportion to stem, thence are more vigorous.
The cones not being injured by kiln-drying,
may also account for this.</p>

<p>The fact that the red pine in Scotland has fewer
sap-wood layers than the red pine of Memel or of
North America, and also the fact that, in most situations
in Scotland, the red
pine soon <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
decays—soonest in the places where the trees have fewest sap-wood
layers, and where the timber has been planted,
that is, where the cones have been kiln-dried—is worthy
of notice. Scots red pine has generally from
15 to 40 layers, Memel from 40 to 50, Canadian often
100. We consider the long moist open winter
and cold ungenial spring in Scotland, and the till
bottoms soaking with water, perhaps aided by the
transplanting, and the kiln-drying of the cones, to be
the cause of this early loss of vitality or change of
sap-wood into matured. In Poland and Prussia, the
earth does not remain so long cold and moist as in
Scotland, but is either frozen or sufficiently warm
and dry;—this occurs even to a greater degree in
Canada<a class="afnanc" href="#fn16" id="fnm16">16</a>, and neither the Memel nor Canadian have
any chance of being planted or kiln-dried.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">W<b>HITE</b></span>
 <span class="smcap">L<b>ARCH</b></span>—<i>Larix communis</i>,
 <span class="nowrap">(<i>L. pyramidalis</i>)</span>.</h3></div>

<p>White Larch is a timber tree combining so many
advantages, its properties so
imperfectly known, of <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
so recent introduction, and of such general culture,
(about 10,000,000 plants being sold annually from
the nurseries of the valley of the Tay alone), that any
accurate notice of its history, its habitudes, and uses,
must possess an interest sufficient to arrest the attention
of every one, from the statesman and economist
down to the mere lord and the squire. We shall
therefore devote to it a little more of our attention
than we have bestowed on those already treated of.</p>

<p>Larch is scattered over a considerable part of the
northern hemisphere, inhabiting nearly the same regions
with the other Coniferæ. White larch, the
kind<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnm17">17</a> common in Britain, is found growing extensively
on the alpine districts of the south of Europe,
in Italy, Switzerland, Sardinia; this may be termed
the European temperate species. Another, native
to the country around Archangel, and extending from <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
Norway eastward through Russia and Siberia, of inferior
size, may be styled the European Hyperborean.
North America, like the old world, is said to
possess a temperate and hyperborean species. The
first, Black Larch (L. pendula), more generally extending
along the longitudinal parallel of the United
States; the other, Red Larch (L. microcarpa), along
that of Lower Canada and Labrador. We have seen
the American temperate attain 18 inches in diameter
in Scotland, but it is much inferior in figure and
growth, and also cleanness of timber, to the Appenine
or European temperate, being covered with knots
and protuberances. Though rough, the timber is
said to be of excellent quality.</p>

<p>It is now upwards of 80 years since the larch, so
common in Britain, was brought from the Appenines
to Strath-Tay. The rapidity of its growth and striking
novelty of appearance, assisted by the influence
of the family of Athole (to a female of which some
say we owe its first introduction), soon attracted general
attention: it quickly spread over the neighbouring
country, and was planted in every variety of
soil and situation, from the unfitness of which, in
most places of the low country, it is already fast decaying.
About 40 years ago it began to be planted
in many parts of Britain. It is now introduced into
almost every new plantation in the
two islands, and <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
the space of country covered by its shade is extending
with a rapidity unparalleled in the history of any
other ligneous plant.</p>

<p>Larch is generally conceived to be an alpine<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnm18">18</a> plant,
and its decay in the low country attributed to situation
or climate. This idea seems to have arisen from
its locality in Italy, and from observing it succeed so
well in our alpine districts, not taking into account
that the soil is different,—that it may be the soil of
these districts which conduces to the prosperity of
the larch, and not the altitude. Throughout Scotland,
wherever we have observed the decay, it appeared
to have resulted almost solely from unsuitableness
of soil. We have witnessed it as much diseased on
our highest trap hills, 1000 feet in altitude, as on a
similar soil at the base. Yet the freeness from putrescency
or miasma of the pure air of the mountain, <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
and deficiency of putrescent matter in the ground,
or other more obscure agencies connected with primitive
ranges, may have some influence to counterbalance
unsuitableness of soil. It is not probable
that the coolness and moisture of altitude would be
necessary in Scotland to the healthy growth of a vegetable
which flourishes under Italian suns, on the
general level of the Appenine and on the Sardinian
hills.</p>

<p>The rot, so general in growing larch, though sometimes
originating in the bulb or lower part of the
stem, seems to have its commencement most frequently
in the roots. Thence the corruption proceeds
upwards along the connecting tubes or fibres into
the bulb, and gradually mounts the stem, which,
when much diseased, swells considerably for a few
feet above the ground, evidently from the new
layers of sap-wood forming thicker to afford necessary
space for the fluids to pass upward and downward—the
matured wood through which there is no
circulation approaching at this place within one or
two annual layers of the outside. In a majority of
cases, the rot commences in the roots which have
struck down deepest into the earth, especially those
under the stool; these having been thrown to a considerable
depth by the young plant, as the tree enlarges,
are shut out from aëration, &amp;c.
by the <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
superior increasing stool and hard-pressed earth underneath
it; this earth at the same time becoming exhausted
of the particular pabulum of the plant. It
is, therefore, quite probable, from these parts of the
roots being the weakest, that they will be most susceptible
of injury from being soaked in stagnant water
in the flat tills<a class="afnanc" href="#fn19" id="fnm19">19</a>, starved during droughts in light
sand, tainted by the putrid vapours of rich vegetable
mould, or poisoned by the corrosive action of pernicious
minerals. It may also be supposed that these
smothered sickly roots, not possessing sufficient power
or means of suction (endosmose), will be left out in
the general economy of vegetation of the plant, thence
lose vitality, and become corrupt. But this affords
no explanation why the larch roots, under these circumstances,
are more liable to corruption than those
of other trees, or how the bulb itself should become
contaminated. <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span></p>

<p>We have cut off the top, where the diameter of
the section was about three inches, from sound young
larch trees, and found a similar rot proceed downwards
in a few months from the section, as rises from
the diseased roots in improper soil. There is something
favourable to the quick progress of this rot in
the motion of the sap, or vitality of the tree; as,
under no common circumstances, would the wood of
a cut larch tree become tainted in so short a time.</p>

<p>The rot, though most general in trees which are
chilled in wet cold tills, or starved in dry sand, or
sickly from any other cause, is also often found to take
place in the most luxuriant growing plants in open
situations, branched to the ground, and growing in
deep soil free from stagnating water. There must,
therefore, be some constitutional tendency to corruption
in the larch, which is excited by a combination
of circumstances; and we must limit our knowledge
for the present to the fact, that certain soils, perhaps
slightly modified by other circumstances, produce
sound, and others unsound larch, without admitting
any general influence from altitude, excepting in so
far as its antiseptic influence may go.</p>

<p>The fitness of soil for larch seems to depend more
especially upon the ability the soil possesses of affording
an equable supply of moisture; that
is, upon its <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
mechanical division, or its powers of absorption
or retention of moisture; and its chemical composition
would seem only efficacious as conducive to
this.</p>

<p>Soils and subsoils<a class="afnanc" href="#fn20" id="fnm20">20</a> may be divided into two classes.
The first, where larch will acquire a size of from 30
to 300 solid feet, and is generally free of rot; the
second, where it reaches only from 6 to 20 feet solid,
and in most cases becomes tainted with rot before
30 years of age.</p>

<span class="smmaj">LARCH.</span></h4>

<p><i>Sound rock, with a covering of firm loam, particularly
when the rock is jagged or cloven, or
much dirupted and mixed with the earth.</i>—In
such cases, a very slight covering or admixture of
earth will suffice. We would give the preference to
primitive rock, especially micaceous schist and mountain
limestone. Larch seldom succeeds well on sandstone
or on trap, except on steep slopes, where the
rock is quite sound and the soil firm.
<span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span></p>

<p>Fully the one half of Scotland, comprehending
nearly all the alpine part, consists of primary rock,
chiefly micaceous schist and gneiss. These rocks
are generally less decayed at the surface, better
drained, and fuller of clefts and fissures containing
excellent earth (especially on slopes), into which
the roots of trees penetrate and receive healthy
nourishment, than the other primitive and transition
rocks, granite, porphyry, trap, or the secondary and
tertiary formations of nearly horizontal strata, red
and white sandstone, &amp;c. Primary strata are generally
well adapted for larch, except where the surface
has acquired a covering of peat-moss, or received
a flat diluvial bed of close wet till or soft moorish
sand, or occupies a too elevated or exposed situation—the
two latter exceptions only preventing the
growth, not inducing rot.</p>

<p><i>Gravel</i>, not too ferruginous, and in which water
does not stagnate in winter, even though nearly
bare of vegetable mould, especially on steep slopes,
and where the air is not too arid, is favourable to
the growth of larch. It seems to prefer the coarser
gravel, though many of the stones exceed a yard
solid.</p>

<p>The straths or valleys of our larger rivers, in their
passage through the alpine
country, are generally <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
occupied, for several hundred feet of perpendicular
altitude up the slope, by gravel, which covers the
primitive strata to considerable depth, especially in
the eddies of the salient angles of the hill. Every
description of tree grows more luxuriantly here than
in any other situation of the country; the causes of
this are, <i>1st</i>, The open bottom allowing the roots to
penetrate deep, without being injured by stagnant
moisture; <i>2d</i>, The percolation of water down through
the gravel from the superior hill; <i>3d</i>, The dryness
of the surface not producing cold by evaporation,
thence the ground soon heating in the spring; <i>4th</i>,
The moist air of the hill refreshing and nourishing
the plant during the summer heats, and compensating
for the dryness of the soil; <i>5th</i>, The reverberating
of the sun’s rays, between the sides of the narrow
valley, thus rendering the soil comparatively
warmer than the incumbent air, which is cooled by
the oblique currents of the higher strata of air, occasioned
by the unequal surface of the ground.
This comparatively greater warmth of the ground,
when aided by moisture, either in the soil or atmosphere,
is greatly conducive to the luxuriancy of
vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Firm dry clays and sound brown loam.</i>—Soils
well adapted for wheat and red clover,
not too rich, <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
and which will bear cattle in winter, are generally
congenial to the larch.</p>

<p><i>All very rough ground, particularly ravines,
where the soil is neither soft sand nor too wet;
also the sides of the channels of rapid rivulets.</i>—The
roots of most trees luxuriate in living or
flowing water; and, where it is of salubrious quality,
especially when containing a slight solution of
lime, will throw themselves out a considerable
distance under the stream. The reason why steep
slopes, and hills whose strata are nearly perpendicular
to the horizon, are so much affected by larch and
other trees, is, because the moisture in such situations
is in motion, and often continues dripping
through the fissures throughout the whole summer.
The desideratum of situation for larch, is where the
roots will neither be drowned in stagnant water in
winter, nor parched by drought in summer, and
where the soil is free from any corrosive mineral or
corrupting mouldiness.</p>

<p>Larch, in suitable soil, sixty years planted, and
seasonably thinned, will have produced double the
value of what almost any other timber would have
done; and from its general adaptation both for sea
and land purposes, it will always command a ready
sale.</p>

<span class="smmaj">LARCH</span> <span class="smmaj">TAKES</span>
<span class="smmaj">DRY</span> <span class="smmaj">ROT.</span></h4>

<p><i>Situations (steep slopes excepted) with cold till
subsoil, nearly impervious to water.</i>—The larch
succeeds worst when moorish dead sand alone, or
with admixture of peat, occupies the surface of
these retentive bottoms. Where the whole soil
and subsoil is one uniform, retentive, firm till, it
will often reach considerable size before being attacked
by the rot. When this heavy till occupies
a steep slope, the larch will sometimes succeed well,
owing to the more equable supply of moisture, and
the water in the soil not stagnating, but gliding
down the declivity.</p>

<p>In general, soils whose surface assumes the appearance
of honeycomb in time of frost, owing to the
great quantity of water imbibed by the soil, will not
produce large sound larch. More than half the low
country of Scotland is soil of this description.</p>

<p><i>Soft sand soil and subsoil.</i>—Sand is still less
adapted for growing larch than the tills, the plants
being often destroyed by the summer’s drought before
they attain size for any useful purpose: the rot also
attacks earlier here than in the tills.
It appears that <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
light sand, sloping considerably on moist back-lying
alpine situations, covered towards the south by steep
hill, will sometimes produce sound larch; whereas
did the same sand occupy a dry front or lowland
situation, the larch would not succeed in it. The
same moist back situation that conduces to produce
sound larch in light dry soils, may probably tend to
promote rot in the wet. The moisture and the less
evaporation of altitude diminishing
the tendency to rot in dry light sand, and
increasing it in wet till. Larch will sometimes succeed
well in sharp dry alluvial sand left by rivulets.</p>

<p><i>Soils incumbent on brittle dry trap, or broken
slaty sandstone.</i>—Although soil, the debris of trap,
be generally much better adapted for the production
of herbaceous vegetables than that of sandstone
or freestone, yet larch does not seem to succeed
much better on the former than the latter. The
deeper superior soils, generally incumbent on the recent
dark red sandstone, are better suited for larch
than the shallow inferior soils incumbent on the old
grey and red sandstone.</p>

<p><i>Ground having a subsoil of dry rotten rock,
and which sounds hollow to the foot in time of
drought.</i></p>

<p><i>Rich deaf earth,
or vegetable <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
mould.</i>—Independently of receiving ultimate contamination from the
putrid juices or exhalations of this soil, the larch
does not seem, even while remaining sound, to make
so much comparative progress of growth, as some
of the hard wood trees, as elm, ash, plane.</p>

<p><i>Black or grey moorish soils, with admixture of
peat-moss.</i></p>

<p>Although the soils specified in this class will not
afford fine large larch for naval use, yet they may be
very profitably employed in growing larch for farming
purposes, or for coal-mines, where a slight taint
of rot is of minor importance. The lightness of
larch, especially when new cut (about one-third less
weight than the evergreen coniferæ), gives a facility
to the loading and carriage, which enhances its value,
independent of its greater strength and durability.
Those larches in which rot has commenced, are fully
as suitable for paling as the sound: they have fewer
circles of sap-wood, and more of red or matured.
When the rot has commenced, the maturing or reddening
of the circles does not proceed regularly,
reaching nearest the bark on the side where the rot
has advanced farthest.</p>

<p>A great amelioration of our climate and of our
soil, and considerable addition to the beauty and
salubrity of the country, might be
attained by <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
landholders of skill and spirit, did they carry off the
noxious moisture, by sufficient use of open drainage,
from their extensive wastes of mossy moors and wet
tills, which are only productive of the black heath,
the most dismal robe<a class="afnanc" href="#fn21" id="fnm21">21</a> of the earth, or rather the funeral
pall with which Nature has shrouded her undecayed
remains. This miserable portion of our country,
so dreary when spread out in wide continuous
flats, and so offensive to the eye of the traveller, unless
his mind is attuned to gloom and desolation, lies
a disgrace to the possessor. Were a proper system
of superficial draining executed on these districts,
and kept in repair, most of our conifers, particularly
spruce and Scots fir, with oak, beech, birch,
alder, and, in the sounder situations, larch, would
thrive and come to maturity, ultimately enhancing
the value of the district an hundred fold. This
could be done by fluting the ground, opening large
ditches every 30, 50, or 100 yards, according to the
wetness or closeness of the subsoil—the deeper, the
more serviceable both in efficacy and distance of
drainage. These flutes should stretch across the
slope with just sufficient declivity to
allow the <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
water to flow off easily, The excavated matter should
be thrown to the lower side; and when the whole,
or any part, of the excavation consists of earth or
gravel, it ought to be spread over the whole mossy
surface, whether the field be morass or drier hill-peat:
this would be useful in consolidating it, and
in preventing too great exhaustion of moisture in
severe droughts, from which vegetation in moss-soil
suffers so much. Even though planting were not
intended, this fluting and top-dressing would facilitate
the raising of the gramineæ. These ditches,
when the ground is not too stoney, or too moist, or
containing roots, might be scooped out, excepting a
little help at the bottom, by means of a scoop-sledge,
or levelling box, worked by a man and two horses,
the surface being always loosened by the common
plough: one of these will remove earth as fast as
twenty men with wheelbarrows.</p>

<h4>ON BENDING AND KNEEING LARCH.</h4>

<p>We cannot too forcibly inculcate the urgent necessity
of attending to the bending of the larch:
for our country’s interest, we almost regret we cannot
compel it. In all larch
plantations, in proper <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
soil, not too far advanced, and in all that may hereafter
be planted, a proportion of those intended to
remain as standards should be bended. The most
proper time for this would perhaps be May or June,
before the top-growth commences, or has advanced
far; the best size is from three feet high and upwards.
The plants should be bent the first season to an angle
of from 40° to 60° with the horizon, and the next
brought down to from 10° to 60°, according to the
size of the plant, or the curve required,—the smallest
plants to the lowest angle.</p>

<p>From experience we find that the roots of larch
form the best of all knees; they, however, might be
much improved by culture<a class="afnanc" href="#fn22" id="fnm22">22</a>, although
it does not <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
seem as yet to have been attempted or thought of.
To form the roots properly into knees, should the
plants be pretty large, the planter ought to select
those plants which have four main roots springing
out nearly at right angles, the regularity of which he
may improve a little by pruning, and plant them out
as standards in the thinnest dryest soil suited for
larch, carefully spreading the roots to equal distances
and in a horizontal position. To promote the regular
square diverging of these four roots, he should dig
narrow ruts about a foot deep and three feet long
out from the point of each root, and fill them in
with the richest of the neighbouring turf along with
a little manure. When the plants are small, and
the roots only a tuft of fibres, he should dig two narrow
ruts about eight feet long crossing each other at
the middle at right angles, fill these as above, and
put in the plant at the crossing: the rich mould of
the rotted turf and its softness from being dug, will
cause the plant to throw out its roots in the form of a
cross along the trenches. When the plants have
reached five or six feet in height, the earth may be
removed a little from the root, and, if more than one
stout root leader have run out into any of the four
trenches, or if any have entered the unstirred earth,
they ought all to be cut excepting
one, the stoutest <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span>
and most regular in each trench. In a few years afterwards,
when the plants have acquired some
strength, the earth should be removed gradually,
baring the roots to from two to five feet distance
from the stool, or as far as the main spurs have kept
straight, cutting off any side-shoots within this distance,
should it be found that such late root-pruning
does not induce rot. This process of baring the
roots will scarcely injure the growth of the trees, as
the roots draw the necessary pabulum from a considerable
distance, nor, if done carefully, will it endanger
their upsetting; and the roots, from exposure to
the air, will swell to extraordinary size<a class="afnanc" href="#fn23" id="fnm23">23</a>, so as to
render them, ere long, the firmest rooted trees in the
wood. The labour of this not amounting to the
value of sixpence each, will be
counterbalanced thrice <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
over by the ease of grubbing the roots for knees;
and the whole brought to the shipwright will produce
more than double the price that the straight
tree alone would have done.</p>

<p><i>The forester should also examine and probe the
roots of his growing larch, even those of considerable
size, in sound ground; and when several
strong horizontal spurs, not exceeding four, are
discovered nearly straight, and from two to five
feet long, he ought to bare these roots to that distance,
that they may swell, carefully pruning
away any small side-roots, and reserve these
plants as valuable store</i>, taking good heed that no
cart-wheel in passing, or feet of large quadruped,
wound the bared roots. In exposed situations the
earth may be gradually removed from the roots.</p>

<p>The rot in larch taking place in the part appropriate
to knees, the forester cannot be too wary in
selecting the situations where there is no risk of its
attack, for planting those destined for this purpose. It
is also desirable, if possible, to have the knee timber
in ground free of stones or gravel, as the grubbing in
stoney ground is expensive, and the roots often embrace
stones which, by the future swelling of the
bulb, are completely imbedded and shut up in the
wood, particularly in those places
between the spurs <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
where the saw section has to divide them for knees.
Were the roots carefully bared at an early period, it
would tend to prevent the gravel from becoming imbedded
in the bulb. Nothing can be more annoying
to the shipwright, when he has bestowed his money,
ingenuity, and labour, upon an unwieldy root, and
brought his knees into figure at the cost of the
destruction of his tools by the enveloped gravel, to
discover stains of incipient rot which renders it
lumber.</p>

<p>This plan of baring the roots might be extended
to oak trees for knees, baring and pruning about a
foot out from the bulb annually. By exposure to
the air, the timber of the root would mature and become
red wood of sufficient durability. When
covered with earth, the root of the oak remains white
or sap wood, and soon decays after being dug up, the
matured wood of the stem scarcely extending at all
underneath the surface of the ground. The roots of
the pine tribe are the reverse of this, at least the
bulb and the spurs near it, are the best matured,
reddest, toughest, most resinous, part of the tree. It
is probably unnecessary to observe, that it would be
folly to remove the earth from the bulb of trees in
situations where water would stand for any length
of time in the excavation. <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span></p>

<p><i>Larch knees are possessed of such strength and
durability, and are of such adaptation by their
figure and toughness, that were a sufficient quantity
in the market, and their qualities generally
known, we believe that none else would be used for
vessels of any description of timber—even for our
war-navy of oak.</i> In America, where it is difficult
to procure good oak knees in their close forest, it is
customary to use them of spruce roots even for their
finest vessels. The knees of vessels have a number
of strong bolts, generally of iron, passing through
them to secure the beam-ends to the sides of the
ship. Larch knees are the more suited for this, as
they do not split in the driving of the bolts, and
contain a resinous gum which prevents the oxidation
of the iron.</p>

<p>As the larch, unlike the oak, affords few or no
crooks naturally, excepting knees, the artificial formation
of larch crooks is of the utmost consequence
to the interest of the holders of larch plantations
now growing. In order to obtain a good market
for their straight timber, it is absolutely necessary
to have a supply of crooks ready as soon as possible
to work the straight up. This would increase the
demand, and thence enhance the price of the straight
more than any one not belonging to
the craft could <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
believe. In good soil many of the crooks would be
of sufficient size in twenty years to begin the supply,
if properly thinned out. In a forest of larch
containing many thousand loads, and which had
been untouched by any builder, we have seen the
greatest difficulty in procuring crooks for one small
brig. It is only on very steep ground, and where
the tree has been a little upset after planting,
that any good crooks are found. From the rather
greater diameter required of larch timbers, and also
from the nature of the fibre of the wood, we should
suppose that steam bending of larch timbers would
scarcely be followed, even as a <i>dernier ressort</i>.</p>

<p>Larch, from its great lateral toughness, particularly
the root, and from its lightness, seems better adapted
for the construction of shot-proof vessels than any
other timber; and opposed <i>end-way</i> to shot in a
layer, arch fashion, several feet deep around a vessel,
would sustain more battering than any other subject
we are acquainted with, metal excepted. Were the
part above water of a strong steam-vessel, having
the paddles under cover, a section of a spheroid or
half egg cut longitudinally, and covered all around
with the root cuts of larch five or six feet deep with
the hewn down bulb, external;
well supported <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
inside, having nothing exposed outside of this arch,
and only a few small holes for ventilators and eyes;
there is no shot in present naval use that would
have much impression upon it. Had such a vessel
a great impelling power, and a very strong iron cutwater,
or short beak wedge-shaped (in manner of the
old Grecian galleys), projecting before the vessel under
water, well supported within by beams radiating
back in all directions, she might be wrought to split
and sink a fleet of men-of-war lying becalmed, in a
few hours. This could be done by running successively
against each, midships, and on percussion immediately
backing the engine, at same time spouting forth
missiles, hot water, or sulphuric acid from the bow
to obstruct boarding; but even though the external
arch were covered with assailants like a swarm of
bees, they would be harmless, or could be easily displaced.
To prevent combustion by red hot shot,
the larch blocks, after drying, might have their pores
filled by pressure with alkali. However, the employment
of bomb-cannon about to be introduced in
naval warfare, throwing explosive shot, regulated
with just sufficient force to penetrate without passing
through the side of the opposed vessel, will render any
other than metallic defensive
cover ineffectual; but <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
this circumstance will, at the same time, completely
revolutionize sea affairs, laying on the shelf our huge
men-of-war, whose place will be occupied with numerous
bomb-cannon boats, whose small size will
render them difficult to be hit, and from which one
single explosive shot taking effect low down in the
large exposed side of a three decker will tear open a
breach sufficient to sink her almost instantly. <i>For
the construction of these boats, larch, especially
were a proportion bent, would be extremely suitable,
and thence larch will probably, ere long, become
our naval stay.</i></p>

<p>Larch has been used in the building-yards of the
Tay for 20 years back; and there is now afloat
several thousand tons of shipping constructed of it.
The Athole Frigate built of it nearly 12 years ago,
the Larch, a fine brig built by the Duke of Athole
several years earlier, and many other vessels built
more recently, prove that larch is as valuable for naval
purposes as the most sanguine had anticipated.
The first instance we have heard of British larch being
used in this manner, was in a sloop repaired with
it about 22 years back. The person to whom it had
belonged, and who had sailed it himself, stated to us
immediately after its loss, that this sloop had been
built of oak about 36 years before; that
at 18 years <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
old her upper timbers were so much decayed as to
require renewal, which was done with larch; that
18 years after this repair this sloop went to pieces
on the remains of the pier of Methel, Fifeshire, and
the top timbers and second foot-hooks of larch were
washed ashore as tough and sound as when first put
into the vessel, not one spot of decay appearing, they
having assumed the blue dark colour which some
timber acquires in moist situations, when it may be
stiled <i>cured</i>; being either no longer liable to the
putrid change constituting dry rot, or which forms
timber into a proper soil for the growth of dry rot;
or, from this blueness caused by the union of the
tannin with iron acting as a poison on vegetation:
this blueness, resulting from some alteration in the
balance of affinities, occurs chiefly in timber containing
much of the tannin principle, in which larch
abounds. The owner of a larch brig who had employed
her for several years on tropical voyages, also
assures us that the timber will wear well in any climate,
and that he would prefer larch to any other
kind of wood, especially for small vessels; he also
states that the deck of this brig, composed of larch
plank, stood the tropical heat well, and that it did
not warp or shrink as was apprehended.</p>

<p>From the softness of the fibre and
want of <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
density of the larch, we would not deem it suitable for
planking vessels beyond the size of ordinary merchantmen,
say 500 tons, as in the straining of very
large vessels, when the greatest force comes upon
the outward skin, the fabric of the wood might
crush before it, along the edge of the plank, and
throw (chew) the oakum. In ordinary sized vessels,
however, larch plank retains the oakum better than
oak, from greater lateral elasticity. For the purpose
of timbers, if root-cuts<a class="afnanc" href="#fn24" id="fnm24">24</a>, and properly bent, we
would think larch suitable to the largest class of
vessels; as, though light, it is tough and quite free
from knot, crack, or cross-grain, which is so common
in oak, and which occasions dense old oak in large
masses to give way at once, before a shock or strain,
the hardness and unyielding nature of the fibre concentrating
the whole dirupting impetus to one point.
Larch may also be advantageously employed in the
ceiling or inside skin of the part of war vessels above
water: shot bores it, comparatively, like an auger,—thence
the structure will endure longer under fire,
and life be much economized.</p>

<p>In all places where larch has become known, it
has completely superseded other
timber for <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
clinker-built boats, surpassing all others in strength, lightness,
and durability. For this purpose, young trees
of about 9 inches diameter, in root-cuts from 10 to
20 feet in length, with a gentle bend at one end,
such as the larch often receives from the south-west
wind, are the most suitable. The log should be kept
in the bark till used, and in dry weather the boards
put upon the boat’s side within two or three days
from being sawn out, as no timber we are acquainted
with parts sooner with its moisture than larch; and
the boards do not work or bend pleasantly when dry.
When dried, the thin larch board is at once strong,
tough, durable, and extremely light. The tough
strength, almost equalling leather, is owing to the
woven or netted structure of the fibre of the wood,
entirely different from the pine, whose reedy structure
runs parallel with very slight connecting or diverging
fibres. It is very difficult to split larch even
by wedges.</p>

<p>For rural purposes generally, larch is incomparably
the best adapted timber, especially for rail or
fence, or out-door fabric exposed to wind and weather.
It is also getting into use for implements of
husbandry, such as harrows, ploughs, and carts. We
have seen a larch upright paling, the timber of
which, with the exception of the
large charred posts, <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span>
had only been eight years in growing, standing a good
fence, sixteen years old, decked out by moss and
lichen in all the hoary garniture of time.</p>

<p>In the construction of buildings, larch is valuable
only for the grosser parts, as beams, lintels, joists,
couples. For the finer boarded part, it is so much
disposed to warp, and so difficult to be worked, as
generally to preclude use. It is, however, asserted
that if larch be seasoned by standing two years with
the bark stripped from the bole before being cut
down, that the timber becomes manageable for finer
house work.</p>

<p>Although larch timber be extremely durable
in exposed situation, yet it yields to the depredations
of insects fully as soon as any pine timber
in close houses. We have proof of it in house-furniture
about 50 years old, but it is considerably
moth-eaten by apparently a smaller insect than common.
Larch stools also disappear in forests sooner
than the stools of Scots fir, being eaten by a species
of beetle; and the sea-worm devours larch in preference
to almost any other wood.</p>

<p>We have looked over some experiments conducted
at Woolwich, in trial of the comparative strength
of larch and other fir timber, where the larch is
stated inferior to Riga and Dantzic
fir, Pitch pine, <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
and even Yellow pine. Larch, in the districts of
Scotland where it is grown and much in use, is universally
allowed to be considerably stronger than
other fir; and the sawyers of it have one-fourth
more pay per stated measure. We, ourselves, have
had considerable experience of the strength of larch
applied to many purposes, and have found it in general
much superior in strength to other fir. We
have known a crooked topmast of this timber, to
which the sailors bore a grudge, defy their utmost
ingenuity to get carried away. We once had four
double horse-carts, made (excepting the wheels) of
peeled young larch of rather slow growth, for the
carriage of large stones; these, by mistake, were
made very slight, so light, that, without the wheels,
a man could have carried one of them away. When
we saw the first loading of stones nearly a ton
weight each, two in each cart, and the timber yielding
and creaking like a willow-basket, we did not
expect they would have supported the weight and
jostlings of a rugged road many yards; yet they
withstood this coarse employment for a long time.
The timber of larch near the top of the tree is, however,
very inferior and deficient in toughness; and it
is not improbable that the experiments above alluded
to at Woolwich had been made
with larch <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
timber deficient in strength from being a top. White
larch has comparatively smaller and more numerous
branches than any other of the Coniferæ; consequently
the timber is freer of large knots, and has
more equable strength, as well in small spars as
when large and cut out into joists and beams, provided
the timber be not too far up the tree. <i>Larch,
however, compared with pines and firs, has the
timber much stronger when young, and several
inches or below a foot in diameter, than when
old and large</i>: this may partly be owing to its deficiency
in resinous deposit.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO PART II.</h3>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm10" id="fn10">10</a>.
We have often preferred the terms kind, breed, family,
individual, to genus, species, variety, subvariety, as the former
seem less definite. Were nature true to the latter classification as
employed by botanists, it would be convenient.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm11" id="fn11">11</a>.
In those we observed, we considered this last
circumstance had a considerable share as a predisposing cause
of the attack of the worm. Forests of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> are
sometimes destroyed by insects under the bark, in cases where
it is difficult to decide whether external circumstances,
such as a dry warm season, has been promotive of the increase
of the insect itself, or has induced some disorder in the
plant, rendering the juices more suitable aliment to the
worm.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm12" id="fn12">12</a>.
Some nautical or technical terms have
unavoidably crept into this work; we shall not presume to
think any explanation necessary: Britannia would blush
<i>jusqu’au blanc des yeux</i>, to the <i>tips</i> of the fingers and
toes, did she think it were doubted that any of her sons, not
doomed to unceasing mechanical labour, were unacquainted with
these.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm13" id="fn13">13</a>.
It is termed by our professors <i>Salix fragilis</i>,
or Crack Willow, from the small branches breaking easily at
the junction of the annual growth—or, perhaps, Crack Willow,
from the branches breaking with considerable report; or from
the wood, while burning, frequently detonating or crackling,
from the expansion of some aërial fluid within the fibres.
Though named by their sapience <i>fragilis</i>, it is not weaker
than other large growing willows, but stronger and denser;
and, being harder in the small branches, they do not bend,
but break when their bark and alburnum is driest, in winter.
The timber is superior to that of <i>Salix alba</i>, or of any
other large growing willow we are acquainted with, and is
sufficiently pliant and tough.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm14" id="fn14">14</a>.
Red Canadian pine is generally termed <i>Pinus
resinosa</i>; but as it is not so resinous as several other
kinds, we consider <i>Pinus rubra</i> (<i>rubra</i> from the colour
of stem and also of timber), which is sometimes used, more
suitable. The pitch pine of the American United States should
be <i>Pinus resinosa</i>.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm15" id="fn15">15</a>.
We think that in mankind the variations of the children of
the same parents do not soften entirely—there would seem to be
certain types or nuclei both of appearance and temperament
around which external and
internal character vibrates.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm16" id="fn16">16</a>.
The Canadian red pine resembles P. sylvestris or
Norway pine so much, that it is usually styled Norway pine
by the settlers: Though different, it is so nearly allied to
P. sylvestris, that we consider the number of sap-growths
may be referred to the climate and soil, and not to the
kind,—that is, that, were it grown in Britain, if it did not
at first, it would in the course of time come to have fewer
sap-growths.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm17" id="fn17">17</a>.
Our common larch, like almost every other kind
of tree, consists of numberless varieties, which differ
considerably in quickness of growth, ultimate size, and value
of timber. This subject has been much neglected. We are,
however, on the eve of great improvements in arboriculture;
the qualities and habits of varieties are just beginning to
be studied. It is also found that the uniformity in each kind
of wild growing plants called <i>species</i>, may be broken down
by art or culture, and that when once a breach is made, there
is almost no limit to disorder; the <i>mele</i> that ensues being
nearly incapable of reduction.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm18" id="fn18">18</a>.
There is yet no sufficient data for the term
alpine plant, but with reference to latitude. The influence
on vegetables, arising from rarefaction and diminution of
pressure of atmosphere, from difference of stimulus of
solar ray—when the entire ray of light, heat, and chemical
power, though less intense, is radiated fresh, and not much
broken or modified by refraction and reflection, and heat
communicated more in proportion by radiation than by contact
of heated air; or from difference of electric or galvanic or
other meteoric impression connected with altitude or ranges
of mountains, or with primary rocks or more upright strata,
has not been made the subject of research, at least has not
been sufficiently investigated by any naturalist.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm19" id="fn19">19</a>.
When water is stationary, either in the pores
of the soil or by itself, if the temperature be not very
low, a slight putrefaction generally commences, aided by the
dead vegetable or animal matter contained in the soil or the
water; and it is only the more robust aquatic vegetables
whose juices are not corrupted, from their roots being
soaked in this tainted fluid. It would appear, too, that the
aqueous part of the atmosphere is also susceptible of the
same putrid changes, although in general the putrescency may
have commenced before the evaporation. This condition of
the aqueous part of the atmosphere is a disposing cause to
blight or mildew in vegetables, and remittent, intermittent,
and putrid fevers in man. Mill-ponds are notorious both for
mildew and agues.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm20" id="fn20">20</a>.
We have had no experience of larch, excepting
very young, growing on chalk and its affinities. We are told
there are a few instances where larch has reached 50 years in
these calcareous soils, some distance south of London. This
merits attention.</p></li>

As we held this plan of forming larch knees,
and of bending larch, of considerable importance, we some
time ago presented it in manuscript, along with some other
matter, to the Highland Society of Scotland. Tiring, however,
of the delay of examination, perhaps unavoidable in their
official departments, and from some improvements occurring to
us during the delay, we requested it back. We now present it
under this more convenient form to the Society, and hope they
will find the examination or perusal of it printed, not quite
so impracticable as when in manuscript. It will afford us
pleasure to know that this useful Society approves, and that
the members who have opportunity are setting about following
our directions. We especially recommend to them to probe the
roots of their growing larch, and to lay bare those fitted
for knees.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm23" id="fn23">23</a>.
The landlord agriculturist is sufficiently
aware of the influence of the baring the upper part of the
root of turnip, while the plant is young, in extending the
future growth of the bulb, and that a dry situation gives
most root in proportion to stem. These are general laws in
vegetation. There are few observers who have not remarked the
very large size which roots have attained when the trees have
originally been planted on dikes, and the dike earth removed,
leaving the roots bare. Should any person examine the very
great difference of thickness between the upper and lower
part, from the heart of a root near the bulb, he will at once
discover the influence of exposure to the air and freeness
from pressure in promoting the swelling.</p></li>

MISCELLANEOUS MATTER CONNECTED
WITH NAVAL TIMBER.</span></h2>

<h3>NURSERIES.</h3>

<p>Much of the luxuriance and size of timber depending
upon the particular variety of the species,
upon the treatment of the seed before sowing, and
upon the treatment of the young plant, and as this
fundamental subject is neither much attended to nor
generally understood, we shall take it up <i>ab initio</i>.</p>
</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The consequences are now being developed of our
deplorable ignorance of, or inattention to, one of the
most evident traits of natural history, that vegetables
as well as animals are generally liable to an almost
unlimited diversification, regulated by climate, soil,
nourishment, and new commixture of already formed
varieties. In those with which man is most intimate,
and where his agency in throwing them from their
natural locality and dispositions has brought out this
power of diversification in stronger shades, it has
been forced upon his notice, as in man himself, in
the dog, horse, cow, sheep,
poultry,—in the apple, <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
pear, plum, gooseberry, potato, pea, which sport in
infinite varieties, differing considerably in size, colour,
taste, firmness of texture, period of growth, almost
in every recognisable quality. In all these kinds
man is influencial in preventing deterioration, by
careful selection of the largest or most valuable as
breeders; but in timber trees the opposite course
has been pursued. The large growing varieties being
so long of coming to produce seed, that many
plantations are cut down before they reach this maturity,
the small growing and weakly varieties,
known by early and extreme seeding, have been continually
selected as reproductive stock, from the ease
and conveniency with which their seed could be procured;
and the husks of several kinds of these invariably
kiln-dried<a class="afnanc" href="#fn25" id="fnm25">25</a>, in order that the seeds might
be the more easily extracted! May we, then, wonder
that our plantations are occupied by a sickly
short-lived puny race, incapable of supporting existence
in situations where their own kind had formerly
flourished—particularly evinced
in the genus <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
Pinus, more particularly in the species Scots fir; so
much inferior to those of Nature’s own rearing,
where only the stronger, more hardy, soil-suited varieties
can struggle forward to maturity and reproduction?</p>

<p>We say that the rural economist should pay as
much regard to the breed or particular variety of his
forest trees, as he does to that of his live stock of
horses, cows, and sheep. That nurserymen should
attest the variety of their timber plants, sowing
no seeds but those gathered from the largest, most
healthy, and luxuriant growing trees, abstaining
from the seed of the prematurely productive, and
also from that of the very aged and over-mature;
as they, from animal analogy, may be expected to
give an infirm progeny, subject to premature decay.</p>

<p>As, from many facts, a considerable influence is
known to result in several vegetables from drying
severely the seeds from whence they had sprung<a class="afnanc" href="#fn26" id="fnm26">26</a>,—from
exposure of these seeds to the sun and air,—from
long keeping, or from injury by mould or <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
impure air, which all tend to shorten the life of the
resulting individual, to accelerate the period of its
seeding, and to increase its reproductiveness; the
nurseryman should pay the utmost attention to the
seeds he makes use of, procuring them as recent as
possible, and preserving them in well-aired lofts, or
under sheds, and also retaining them in the husks
till the time of sowing: the superior germinating
power of the seed thus treated will repay this attention.</p>

<p>From facts we are also assured, that, in some hard
wood kinds, and also in the Coniferæ, the hanging of
the growth of the young plant, the spindling up in the
seed-bed, or injudicious deterring treatment afterwards,
have a tendency to injure the constitution of
the individual, inducing premature seeding, and diminutive
old age; and also, that when plants, especially
of some size, of these kinds of trees have their
roots much broken, the secondary or new roots often
partake something of the nature of the infirm runners,
which, in most kinds of trees, are thrown out
by layers,—the resulting tree, as in the case of those
from layers in fruit trees being dwarfish, sooner exhausting
itself by reproduction, and sooner decaying.
For distinctness,
we shall recapitulate: <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span></p>

<p>That the seed be from the largest, hardiest variety
of tree in luxuriant growth.</p>

<p>That the seed be recent, and carefully preserved
in husk till sowing, and extracted from the husk or
cone without artificial drying.</p>

<p>That the nursery be in an open, rather exposed
situation,—most eligible without shelter either of
tree, hedge or wall, of rather light dry soil of ordinary
quality, of dry climate, and, in preference, soil
naturally good to that made so by high manuring.</p>

<p>That the plants be not too close, nor remain too
long in the seed-bed; that they be extricated without
much fracture of root, and be replanted in wide rows,
with good space between the plants in the row, keeping
the roots as superficially extended as they will
thrive, and without doubling the main root up to the
surface of the ground.</p>

<p>That the plant receive no pruning, excepting in
the case of more than one leader appearing, or feeder
unproportionally extended; and no root-section, in
order to retard its growth, or increase the number of
root-fibres; and that its ultimate removal be accomplished
without much fracture of root or branch.</p>

<p>By exposed situation of nursery, ordinary quality
of soil, and much room in the seed-bed
and rows, we <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
shall have plants with firm fibre and hardy constitution,
with thick juicy bark, thick stem at the surface of
ground, and numerous feeders all the way down the
stem. Roots are most easily extricated from light
soil, and with least fracture. They are large in proportion
to stem in dry soil and climate, and when
they are situated near the surface of the ground.—A
healthy growing plant, of firm fibre, large root,
and sturdy short stem of one leader and numerous
feeders, is the great desideratum: a large root is the
more desirable, as a considerable part of it is generally
broken off in transplanting, rendering it disproportioned
to the top, which, in consequence, either
languishes, or receives deterring cropping.</p>

<p>We consider, that a tree grows more luxuriantly,
acquires larger size, and is much longer of
reaching senility, when it is furnished with several
large roots, say one or two to each of the cardinal
points, extending horizontally out with bold leaders,
than when numerous small rootlets diverge in all
directions from the bulb, as is the case in some kinds
when much fracture of root takes place from frequent
removals, or, when the nursery is of moist or mossy
soil, the plants being removed when of considerable
size. We have cut down old stunted hard wood
trees having extremely numerous
crowded roots, all <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
engrafted into a matted net throughout the soil near
the bulb, and without any strong extended leaders.
We attributed this crowded rooting to the plants
having been of considerable size when put in, and
losing their natural leaders; the situation, an avenue
exposed to cattle, went to confirm the probability
that the defect of the rooting had been owing to
the largeness of the plants.</p>

<p>When a tree is supplied by numerous, consequently
small and not wide-extending roots, as the tree
acquires size, the wide spreading branches and leafy
top shed off the rain and dews from the space occupied
by these roots, very few of them extending beyond
this shade; at the same time, this narrow space
becomes soon exhausted of the more particular pabulum
necessary to the kind of plant, the exhaustion being
accelerated by the dryness. This dryness and exhaustion
of the soil very soon show their effects aloft;
the living hark of the tree becomes covered from its
connexion with the air, and constricted by a thick
hard dead crust, which, with the consequent very
thin alburnum affording an inefficient communication
between the supply and demand, react to impair
the general vigour, and particularly to impede the
descent of the proper sap necessary to the enlargement
and further extension of the
roots. The buds <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span>
not receiving sufficient supply of root-moisture, instead
of pressing on to new formation of wood, only
find enough to burgeon out into flower-buds, which
the following season drain the tree by reproduction;
this fruit-bearing alternates with periods of exhaustion,
when the buds have not even supply sufficient
to swell into the embryo of flower and seed, but extend
only into a few leaves; and sometimes, in the
event of a benign season, the buds may throw out a
small extension of new shoots. The tree progresses
very slowly in thickness of bole all this time, and
generally soon falls a prey to disease. On the other
hand, when the tree has its naturally fine large roots
preserved, and is situated in open forest, and mixed
with other kinds, these large roots diverging widely
from the tree and each other, have a much larger
less-sought space to forage in; and the tree enjoying
a long period of luxuriant growth before it fall much
into seed-bearing, acquires strength of constitution
to thrive and increase for ages under this drain.</p>

<p>We are satisfied that cutting or fracture of the
root-leaders, especially near the bulb, when they have
acquired some size, is injurious to the extension and
longevity of the tree, in pines and most kinds of
hard wood; and that branch-pruning, as generally
practised, is not less pernicious, first,
by the <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
derangement which the plant receives, from the regular connexion
between the rootlets and their affiliated
twigs and leaves being destroyed by the section,
and afterwards from the distance between the manufacturing
parts, the leaves and the sources of supply
in the ground being unnaturally extended, especially
when the stem is long, slender, and much denuded.</p>

<p>Although we consider severe root fracture at planting
pernicious to some hard wood and resinous trees,
yet there are kinds to which it is advantageous. All
plants which grow freely by cuttings, strike better
to have the roots pruned in near to the bulb. Many
kinds of seedling-plants also strike sooner, and throw
out stronger new root-leaders, when the long straggling
fibres are cut in a little, similar to the branches
above, which, when over-numerous and slender, throw
out more vigorous shoots by being cropped at planting.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>PLANTING.</h3></div>

<p>In regard to planting, soils divide into the <i>dry</i>
and the <i>moist</i>; the former require to have the plants
put in as soon as possible after the leaves drop off—at
any rate, not to allow February to pass without
completing the
planting; excepting evergreens, <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
which should not be delayed beyond the middle of
April. In dry soils, if the expense be not limited to
a very low rate, pit-planting should be adopted, and
the pits are better to be dug some months previous,
in order that the earth may be aërated, and the turf
partly rotted. The moist soils may be divided into
those which are much disposed to throw the plant
from the frosts and thaws, and those which are not;
the former consisting of moory, soft, or spongy earth,
upon a retentive subsoil; the latter, of the firmer,
more equable loams, clays, and tills. Unless the
plants are large, they should always be slitted into
the former soil, and the work performed as soon as the
ground becomes sadded in spring—as, though the lateness
of planting should preclude throwing of pitted
plants the first season, they will often be thrown the
ensuing winter. When plants are very small, they
may be put into the latter, by slitting; but if middle-sized,
or large, they are better pitted. It is of the
greatest importance to these moist soils, to have very
deep, open<a class="afnanc" href="#fn27" id="fnm27">27</a> drains executed previous to planting,
cutting off all the springs at their sources, and, if
possible, drying the subsoil to such a degree that
water will not stand in the pits. Should this be <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
accomplished, it is highly advantageous to dig the
pits in time for the excavated clay to have its cohesion
broken by frost: the planting should afterwards
be performed exactly at the time when this frosted
mould is sufficiently dry, and no more, to shake
conveniently in among the fibres of the roots, and
not to knead into mortar, by the necessary pressing
of the feet. After this pressure, a little of the tenderest
of the soil should be spread loose over the
surface, to exclude drought. Should this dryness of
subsoil not be effected, the pits must be dug in
spring, at the time the clay is most friable; that is,
between the moist and dry; and the plants put in
immediately, breaking the clay as fine as possible,
and closing it well around the roots. It is better
to delay planting even till May, than to perform it
too wet. When planting is delayed late in spring,
the plants should be kept <i>shoughed</i> in the coldest
situation that can be found, at the top of a hill exposed
to the north, or in some cold, damp, back-lying
place. Care should also be taken not to expose them
much while planting, as they, especially if the buds
be bursting, very soon wither when root and stem
are both exposed to the sun and dry air. When
late planted, they ought always to be dipped as far
up as the branches in a puddle of
clay and water: <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
should they be dipped over head in the puddle, it
will not injure them.</p>

<p>What is of most importance to the success of
planting, is to have the soil put very closely in contact
with all the root-fibre, and these fibres in due
natural separation, with a little tender mould on the
surface;—not to have water stagnating around the
root, at any rate during the first spring;—to have
the planting done in time, to receive a good sadding
by rain before the spring droughts commence;—to
prevent rank weeds, furze, &amp;c. from smothering the
young plants;—and to exclude or destroy all bestial,
as cattle, sheep, rabbits, hares, mice, &amp;c. In keeping
the latter in check, a few families of foxes are
very efficient.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON PRUNING.</h3></div>

<p>Every forester is aware, that when feeders are
pruned off, they should be cut away as close as
possible to, and without tearing the hole. To perform
this without danger of injury to the tree,
when feeders of considerable size are to be removed,
the branch should first be sawn over at about one
foot beyond the intended section, and a second section
then performed at the proper
place. This <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
requires a little more time, but not nearly so much as
an inexperienced person would suppose, as the section
a foot out is made very quickly, and the pruner
generally takes as much time to reach the branch as
to cut it off. The neatness and advantage of this
method will be acknowledged by those who have
seen it practised, to compensate for the longer time
it requires.</p>

<p>We find the saw, shears, and knife, the best instruments
for pruning; in some cases of difficult approach,
the long-handed pruning-iron may be resorted
to. When the lopping is performed by a percussion
tool, the wood and bark at the section is often
shattered by the blow, and thence is less likely to
cicatrize soundly; and even when executed in the
best manner, the surface of the section is smooth and
hard, consequently a good conductor of heat, dries
much, and thence shrinks and cracks near the centre
of the cut, opening a deep crevice, into which the
rain penetrates, and often rots deep into the stem.
When the section is made by the saw, a slight fibrous
clothing is left upon the place, which in some
measure protects the ends of the cut tubes from the
frost and drying air, and excludes the heat; in consequence
the wood at the section does not lose its vitality
so far inward, and is not so
liable to shrink <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
and crack in the centre and receive rain. The section
can also generally be made much neater and
closer by the saw than by any other instrument.
The common erroneous belief, that a section by a
sharp-edged instrument is less injurious than by the
saw, is merely hypothetical, from wide analogy from
animals. The pernicious influence on the whole individual,
received and transmitted by the nerves
from mangled section of animal fibre, is probably entirely
awanting in vegetables; the whole process of
life and of cicatrization is also totally different.</p>

<p>The forester should also be very wary in cutting
off a considerable branch, whose section would incline
upwards, as such a section, when it has received
a circle of new bark and wood, forms a cup which
receives and contains rain water, which quickly corrupts
the bottom of the cup, and often rots the centre
of the tree down to the ground. It is better to
crop such a branch several feet from the main stem,
close by some small feeder, unless the branch be
dead. In pruning, every considerable section should
be as near as possible at right angles with the horizon,
or rather inclining inward below. Of naval
timber, the beech is by far the most likely to take
rot by being pruned, and should never have a large
limb cut off, as the divided fibres
generally die <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
downward a number of feet below the section, and soon
afterward decay, leaving a hole in the bole.</p>

<p>As nothing retards the growth of trees more than
full flowering and seeding, if pruning diminish this
flowering and seeding, so that the gain from the prevention
of this exhaustion more than counterbalances
the loss of the pruned-off part, the pruning will of
course accelerate the growth of the tree; but the removal
of lower branches, although in the first place
promotive of growing buds and extension of the top,
in a year or two longer only tends to throw the tree
more into flowering and seeding. The rich dryness,
or want of fluidity of the juices which occasions flower-buds,
is also induced by hot, dry atmosphere, and
short supply of moisture from the roots during the
preceding summer, both of which disposing causes
are increased by a long naked stem. When the
proportion of the part above ground of a tree to the
roots is diminished, growing buds result, at least to a
certain extent; yet it would be very difficult to practise
a proper system of pruning on this principle,
as the consequent lengthened stem is, in the end,
promotive of flower-buds, especially in dry seasons,
and the loss of feeders might greatly counterbalance
the gain from not flowering, did a succession of wet
cold seasons follow. <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span></p>

<p>The season when pruning should be performed, is
something dependent upon the kinds, whether they
bleed when pruned in early spring or do not. Almost
any convenient time will suit for pruning the latter,
but we rather prefer March, April, May, June, or
autumn after the leaf has fallen. The former, sycamore,
maple, birch, &amp;c. ought either to be pruned
in autumn, or after the buds are beginning to break
in spring, as they bleed and suffer considerable exhaustion
when pruned in the latter part of winter or
early spring. From some facts, we consider that
pruning in winter, especially in severe weather, gives
a check to the vigour of the tree; others agree with
this.</p>

<h3 id="p122">
OBSERVATIONS ON TIMBER.</h3></div>

<p>The quantity of measurable wood of the various
timber trees which a certain extent of adapted ground
will carry, when come to full maturity, or when they
may be most profitably felled, and the quantity that
may be thinned out during the maturing, with the
time requisite to bring to value, with the relative
selling price per foot, and also whether the greatest
quantity of timber can be grown of one kind or
mixed, are questions of more importance than
might be judged, from the attention paid to the subject.
Of our common timber trees, Scots fir, silver
fir, and spruce, larch, pinaster, black Italian poplar,
Salix alba, commonly called Huntingdon willow,
red-wood willow, beech, Spanish chestnut, ash, plane,
elm, birch, oak, are here ranked nearly in the order
of quantity of measure which adapted ground in this
country will produce or support; that is, that an
acre of close Scots fir trees, of whatever age, will admeasure
more timber than an acre covered with any
other tree of the same size; and a close acre of oaks
less. A little further south, in the temperate zone,
the large-leaved deciduous
trees, particularly the <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
elms, acquire thicker and longer stem, in closer order,
in a given time. In this country, in rich warm
situations, this is visible in some degree, both as regards
quantity of timber and quickness of growth,
compared with pines. It would be difficult to state
the comparative quickness of growth of the various
timber trees, as so much depends on soil, situation,
and treatment; it also varies considerably at different
stages of their growth. It is well known, that
in proper soil, black Italian poplar, Salix alba, and
red wood willow, exceed all others.</p>

<p>As, for naval use, it is not the quickness of growth and
bulk of the timber altogether, but of the matured timber
alone, which is of consequence—we give a view of the number
of growths or annual circles of sap-wood (the useless
part), which the main stems of several kinds of trees
presented. Most of those we examined had a greater number
of sap-layers near the top than at a few feet above ground,
and the vigorous branches had generally more than the stem
immediately adjacent to them; the branches with least vigour
had fewest sap circles. <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span></p>

</div><!--dctr02-->

<p>The process of maturing in several did not proceed
regularly, some of the rings being reddened on
one side and remaining white on the other: this
did not seem to be influenced by position to south
or north. In the larch, particularly
in those trees <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
where the rot is incipient, this maturing is very irregular,
in the view of the cross section dashing out
into angles and irregularities, and being darker red
than in the healthy plants: in those where rot had
made considerable progress, the red-wood was within
a circle or two of the bark. This approach of
red-wood to the outside is so regularly connected
with rot, that we needed no other indication of the
roots being unfit for knees, and therefore not worth
grubbing, than merely a slight notch by two cuts of
a hatchet.</p>

<p>Those kinds of timber whose matured wood assumes
a brown or reddish colour, are generally much
less susceptible of change, either by simple putrefaction
or by attack of fungi, or gnawing of insects,
than those whose matured wood remains of a whitish
colour. In many of the latter, there does not even
appear to be any particular change of constitution,
or greater capability of resisting corruption or insects,
between the alburnum and mature wood, although
the difference between the two is generally
perceptible when the cross section is drying, and immediate,
as in the brown or red; there being no gradual
change or softening in either between the mature
and immature. Although the change in those
which become brown and red does
not much affect <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
the hardness or strength of the timber (mature and
immature being nearly equal in these when dried
before corruption injures the latter), yet it materially
influences its nature or quality. We have taken
down Laburnum trees in the round natural form
from the roofing of an old building, from which
nearly the whole yellow or sap-wood was eaten away
by insects, although they had not made the least impression
upon the brown<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnm28">28</a>. <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span></p>


<p>Whether timber be more lasting when cut at
one time of the season than at another, is not yet
determined. The matured wood does not seem to
be much affected by the season, continuing nearly
equally moist throughout the year; life or action
in it, though not quite, being nearly extinct, and
little or no circulation remaining; yet the matured
wood of the stool of the pine throws out a little resin
when the tree is cut down in summer,—perhaps
only a mechanical effect of heat and drying.
Steeping in water for a considerable time is of far
more importance to the duration of timber than
any thing depending on the time of the season
when it is cut down; steeping causes some acetous <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
change in the timber (easily recognisable by the
sense of smelling when any section of it is made),
which, judging from the effect the acetous change has
to preserve other vegetable matter from putrefaction,
is probably of considerable use in preserving the
timber from decay, either by rot or worming. The
time of cutting, although of considerable importance
to the quality and durability of the sap-wood, appears
to be of little or none to the matured.</p>

<p>The age at which timber may be cut down
being uncertain, the height to which it should be
trained up of clear stem is not very determinable,—say
that the trees are to be allowed to stand till
nearly full grown,—as long as the timber continues to
retain its strength and toughness when growing in
proper soil, that is for hard-wood trees 100 years
and upwards, and for pines from two to three hundred.
On crowns of eminences and exposed bluffs,
particularly when the latitude or altitude is rather
high, the soil inferior, or the climate arid, from 15
to 30 feet of clear hole may be as much as can judiciously
be attempted; upon plains under common
circumstances, from 30 to 50 feet is an attainable
stem; in sheltered dales and valleys, they may be
trained clean, and without branch, from 50 to 70
feet in altitude; and in cases
where soil, situation, <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
and climate, are all propitious, and it is desired that
nature’s fullest, grandest, development should be displayed,
from 70 to 150 feet, clear of branch, maybe
gained. Lewis and Clarke describe a spruce, in a
sheltered dell on the river Columbia, which they measured,
lying upon the ground, 312 feet long from
root to top. We have little belonging to earth more
sublime, or which bears home to man a deeper sense
of his bodily insignificance, and puny transient being,
than an ancient majestic forest, whose luxuriant foliage
on high, seems of itself almost a firmament of
verdure, supported on lofty moss-covered columns,
and unnumbered branched arches,—a scene equally
sublime, whether we view it under the coloured and
flickering lights and shadows of the summer eve
and morning, resounding to the song of the wild
life which harbours there,—or under the scattered
beams streaming downward at high noontide when
all is still,—or in winter storms, when the wild jarring
commotion, the frightful rending and lashing of the
straining branches, like the arms of primeval giants,
contending in their might, bear accompaniment to
the loud roar and bellow of the tempest, forming a
drone and chaunter to which
demons might dance.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="p130">CONCERNING OUR MARINE, &amp;c.</h3></div>

<p>Can we consider the Briton sane who speaks of
bounding this country to her home resources? Can
any one doubt that our name, our wealth, our
power, are not wholly attributable to our <i>Marine</i>?
Can any one be ignorant that the superiority of our
marine is wholly dependant on our <i>foreign trade</i>,
particularly the bulkier part of it, on <i>foreign supply</i>?
Does any one dread the necessity of <i>foreign
supply</i>, from the foolish fear that it may be cut off
by war? Keeping out of view the argument, that
ere the British pride would suffer <i>other domination
on the waters</i>, our numbers would be well thinned
away, they know little of the influence of circumstance
on man, who do not perceive that, in the event
of free trade, and of the population of Britain increasing
beyond what the country, under the best
possible culture, could support, the very necessity of
being mistress of the seas would make her so. They
know little of what Britain is, country and people,
who doubt of her continued supremacy, should she
not be ruined, indeed, by following
the narrow selfish <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
views of a party—a party alike ungrateful<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnm29">29</a> for the
past, and blind to, or heedless of, their own ultimate
good. The position of Britain,—her stretch
of sea-coast, serrated with harbours,—her minerals,
the principle of mechanical motion, so necessary in
the arts,—her navy, docks, canals, roads, implements,
and machinery, so superior to those of the
whole world beside,—her fertile soil,—her capital,—her
protection of property,—her insular situation,—her
steady government and consequent ingress of
capital from the continent on any commotion,—her
habits of industry,—her knowledge of trade,—her
sciences,—her arts,—her free press,—her <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
religion<a class="afnanc" href="#fn30" id="fnm30">30</a>,—and the stamina and indomitable spirit of her people.
All these, causes and effects combined, brought
into action under a climate the most favourable for
developing the moral and physical energies of man,
where the extremes of temperature neither relax
nor chill, where the human muscle and human mind
are more capable of continued strong exertion, and
machinery less influenced by hygrometric and calorific
change, than on any other spot of earth. When
all these are condensed into a nucleus of power of so
small compass that one spirit, one interest, may pervade
all, but drawing support by ramifications from
every nook of the habitable world, should an infatuated
party not render unavailable these unmatched
advantages, cowardice could not even dream of peril
to the supremacy of British naval power.</p>

<p>Let us continue to extend our foreign intercourse and home
cultivation—let the merchant legislate in affairs of
trade—the landholder in country matters; each in that in
which his judgment has been formed by experience, acting
always on the principle that the general prosperity of the
country is the interest <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
of every class—that, like the branch and the root,
their prosperity is indissolubly combined.</p>

<p>When we view the advantages of Britain—almost
to a wish,—when we view her able and ready to
supply the necessities of man in every clime, in exchange
for his superfluities, and to scatter science,
morality, the arts of life, all that conduces to happiness
and improvement over the nations,—when we
view all this, being blasted by an exclusive system
of monopoly, of very doubtful advantage to one party
of the nation, and tyrannically oppressive upon all
others, can we refrain from execration? We would
desire the casuist to draw a distinction between the
criminality of preventing the operative from exchanging
the produce of his labour (otherwise unsaleable)
for cheap food<a class="afnanc" href="#fn31" id="fnm31">31</a>, when his family is famishing;
and compelling the labour of the Negro (whom
you support with food) with the whip. Men will
be found of a virtue sufficiently easy to advocate
either system. We only wish that
the supporters of <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
monopoly and their abettors were sent off to some
separate quarter of the world with all their beloved
restrictions, duties, tariffs, passports, revenue officers,
blockade men, with the innumerable petty interfering
vexatious regulations, and all the contrivances
which surely the devil has invented to repress industry
and promote misery, where they might form an
Elysium of their own.</p>

<p>There is nothing more certain, should we by restrictions
continue to banish knowledge, capital, and
industry from our shores<a class="afnanc" href="#fn32" id="fnm32">32</a>, than that the Genius of
Improvement will fix upon some other place for the
seat of her throne. <i>Maritime dominion</i> will follow
in her train; and on the first war, all exportation
of the products of our manufacturers being at an
end, unexampled misery will involve four-fifths of
our population, and an explosion will ensue, from its
origin and character of unparalleled fury, which will
sweep to destruction the insane authors of the calamity—tear
to shreds the whole fabric of society—and
give to the winds all the institutions which man
has been accustomed to revere. <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span></p>

<hr class="hr12" />

<p>It is disgraceful that our <span class="smcap">M<b>ARINE</b></span> is not directly
represented in the British Parliament. Is it possible
that every clown in England, who is owner of a few
acres or miserable hovel, is carried to the poll,—and
that our shipping interest, and brave seamen, to
whom the rest of the nation is indebted “for all
they have, and almost all they know,” are passed
over—have not one direct representative—have not
even one direct vote, and that their interest is totally
neglected<a class="afnanc" href="#fn33" id="fnm33">33</a>? Will it be credited that our most
sage legislators, as if on purpose to ruin our marine,
have laid on a tax of L. 4 per load (above 1s. 7d.
per solid foot) on oak-plank, and L. 2, 15s. per load
on rough oak-timber, imported from other nations;
which, as only a small part of what is (not of what
would be) used, is so derived, at the same time that
it raises the price of the whole<a class="afnanc" href="#fn34" id="fnm34">34</a> nearly 100 per cent.,
tends comparatively little to swell the revenue,—nearly
the whole of the high monopoly price reverting
to our landholders and
our grateful Canadian <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
colony? As about a load (50 solid feet) of timber
is required for the construction of a ton of trading
shipping, this duty, together with the high duty on
hemp, increases the cost of our vessels nearly L. 4
per register ton, independent of the higher price of
building and sailing them, from other monopolies;
and it is only from the very superior skill, honesty
and industry of our seamen<a class="afnanc" href="#fn35" id="fnm35">35</a>, that our shipping, since
the peace, under this very great disadvantage, has
been at all enabled to compete with foreign. At
Shields and Newcastle a new merchant-vessel of oak,
rigged and ready for sea, uncoppered, can be purchased
for L. 10 per register ton. Were the price,
by the removal of monopoly, reduced to L. 6 per ton,
scarcely a foreign bottom, American excepted, would
compete with British, in the carrying trade, or would
enter a British port. Can it be believed that our
very liberal late minister (Mr Huskisson), and our
very non-liberal member for Newark (Mr Sadler),
have both made a <i>full</i> exposè of the distresses of our
shipping interest, and not once have adverted to the
<i>cause</i> of this, and of the comparative decline of our
naval preponderance—<i>the very high duty on the</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
<i>material</i>? Does our Government perceive the rapid
strides which our rival brothers in America are making
to surpass us in marine—and will it be so besotted
as continue laws to the speedy fulfilment of this?</p>

<p>May we hope that, through the energy of <span class="smmaj">OUR</span> <span class="smcap">S<b>AILOR</b></span> <span class="smcap">K<b>ING</b></span>, Britain will lead the van in the disenfranchisement
of man from the old bondage of
monopoly and restriction—that a more sane system
of taxation (a tax on property) will be adopted, as
well as a necessary retrenchment—that the true interest
of Britain will be understood and followed,
and a new era begin. We are sick of the drivelling
nonsense of our closet economists about loss by colonies
and foreign connexion. Bonaparte well knew
the value of <span class="smmaj">SHIPS</span>, <span class="smmaj">COLONIES</span> and <span class="smmaj">COMMERCE</span>,
and dreaded the power which eventually wrought
his fall. The existence of China depends upon her
Agriculture, and the sovereign devotes a part of his
time annually to the plough. The existence of Britain
depends upon her Marine, and the king should
always be bred a sailor—the heir-apparent and presumptive
being always sent to sea. In the case of
a female, if she did not take kindly to the sea-service,
a dispensation might be allowed, on her
marrying a sailor, and the foolish law prohibiting
our Royal Family from marrying a Briton be put aside.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm27" id="fn27">27</a>.

Laburnum (Cytisus) is the most valuable timber this country
produces. It is equally deep in colour, and takes as fine a
polish as rose-wood, having also something slightly pellucid
in the polished surface. From its extreme hardness, it
is much better adapted for use than mahogany, not being
indented or injured by blows or rough treatment. We are
acquainted with no other timber of home produce so little
liable to decay. The large-leaved variety in rich warm
soils acquires a diameter of a foot or a foot and a-half,
and grows rapidly till it fall into seed-bearing. Its usual
very stunted growth is partly owing to less valuable faster
growing trees overtopping it: Were it planted alone, and
trained to proper curve, it might be profitably reared for
the upper timbers (the part where decay commences) of small
vessels: it has the thinnest covering of sap wood of any of
our timber trees. The extreme beauty and richness of its
clustered depending blossoms is a considerable injury to its
growth, as it is often broken and despoiled of the branches
on this account. The small-leaved Laburnum, though producing
the most beautiful timber, is of such puny growth as not
to rank as a forest tree. There is a peculiarity, at least
seldom occurring in other trees, attending the growth of the
small-leaved variety: a branch frequently gives up feeding
the connected trunk and roots, drawing supply of nourishment
from these upward, without returning much or any of the
digested matter downward. This branch above the place of the
stagnation of the bark vessels becomes enlarged, running
into numerous shoots, which are generally unnaturally thick
and unhealthy, approaching to dropsical—often, however,
beautifully pendant down to the ground, from their weight
and the smallness of the supporting branch. We do not know
whether this is an awkward effort towards increase—that
these branches, under the influence of a not entirely matured
instinct or faculty, droop in search of earth to root, and
extend by layers, in conformity to a habit of some tribes of
trees, in which this mode of increase is efficient, or that
it is a disease unconnected with design or final cause. These
overgrown branches of the small-leaved laburnum are generally
thrown out by trees, which, owing to circumstances, are
little disposed to seeding.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm29" id="fn29">29</a>.
Let us compare the wealth of the British landholder with
that of the like grade on the Continent. It is the unrivalled skill
and industry of our manufacturers and traders which have laid
every shore under contribution for the immense riches which has
poured in upon our landholders, and which, from juxtaposition,
will continue to do so, in a certain degree, under the fullest freedom
of trade. It is now absurd to talk of duties on foreign products,
to counterbalance home taxation—taxation now bears
lightly on home agricultural production, more so than in many
parts of the Continent, and our manufacturers, under the same or
greater taxation, compete with and outstrip all the world in
cheapness of production.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm30" id="fn30">30</a>.
The dread of change in Catholic countries—the proscription
of almost every new work treating of science—the complete
submission of the mind to the religious authorities, bearded
men “becoming little children” even to the letter—the
consequent general abandonment to sensual enjoyment—the
immense number of holidays—and the shoals of meddling
priests, are a great bar to improvement—an insurmountable
one to manufacturing pre-eminence. We need not say that all
this is subordinate to climate. Effect, however, soon turns
to cause.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm31" id="fn31">31</a>.
Our industrious operatives, rendered trebly more productive
by recent machinery improvements, fabricate three times more
commodity than our landed and other population can with their
present habits consume. Few other nations can give else but
food in exchange for this overplus; our landholders have enacted
laws to exclude food, and our operatives are being starved down
to the requisite number
for home supply.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm32" id="fn32">32</a>.
The same polity under which Britain has acquired supremacy,
will not now serve to continue it. A knowledge of the
interests of nations is abroad, and if we will not suffer our country
to be the emporium of the
world, another will.</p></li>

NOTICES OF AUTHORS RELATIVE TO
TIMBER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After throwing together several of our own observations,
we bethought ourselves of examining into
the ideas and experience of recent writers on the
same subject. Having taken notes of the more prominent
matter contained in their pages, we believe
we shall do the public a service by printing these
notes, accompanied by slight remarks. This may
be the more useful, especially as almost every author
has his own particular mania, which few common
readers have sufficient knowledge of the subject to
discriminate from the saner matter: and as, from
the nature of hobbies—from some shrewd enough
guesses by the owner that they are his own undoubted
property—and, perhaps, from some misgivings,
that what he advances on these is not perfectly
self-evident, he is thence the more disposed
to expatiate upon them, and
embellish. The <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
credulous and inexperienced, partly from this, and partly
from the fascination of the very improbability, rush
at once into the snare; bring the speculations or
assertions to practical test; get quickly disenchanted
by realities, and ever after are disposed to treat all
written directions on material science with contempt.
We bring forward these authors in the order of perusal.
We have found several remarks similar to our
own; this was to be expected.</p>

<span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>ORESTER’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">G<b>UIDE</b></span>, <i>by Mr Monteath</i>.</h3>

<p>This volume is the work of a man of some experience,
and of considerable observation and ingenuity,
not much assisted by botanical or physiological
science or literary attainment, which he, indeed, disclaims.
His principal forte, and what he seems to
have been most engaged with, is oak-coppice—his
besetting sin, cutting and cropping. His directions
on rearing and cutting coppice may be sensible;—those
who wish to practise the sacrilege of destroying
young oak-forest, we refer to him, as we have
always had a horror at seeing a beautiful sapling
untimeously cut down, like an American bullock for
its hide. At present, and while peace continues, it
is very easy to obtain plenty of foreign bark, and
also oak-timber, for consumption, at a very cheap
rate, for this reason—<i>and also, because, in the event
of war, the price of these articles would be nearly
doubled—we would request the holders of coppice,
and, indeed, of all growing oak-timber, to pause
in their operations of cutting, and not to sacrifice
their property so unprofitably, to their own ultimate
disadvantage, and also to
the detriment of</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
<i>the national resources; but immediately to set
about converting their coppice-hags into oak-forest,
by careful thinning and selection</i>. For performing
this, we refer them to Mr Monteath in person, who
seems to comprehend the utility, and to be pretty
well versed in the practice, of thinning; only we
would desire him, in pruning, to attend to the functions
of the leaves; that the more abundant the
covering of healthy foliage, the tree will progress
the faster; and that the repeated cutting down of a
young plant, year after year, as he recommends, even
sometimes extending it to five years in succession,
will either destroy the plant altogether, or be extremely
injurious to its growth: although, if the
plant be stunted, cutting it down, once, as every
body knows, is the plan which should be adopted
with all kinds of our common forest trees—the coniferæ,
beech, and birch, excepted.</p></div>

<p>Mr Monteath advises a naturalization of young
plants, after they are got from nurseries, in a soil
and climate similar to that which they are ultimately
to occupy. We see no necessity for this. All
that is required in a young plant, is, that it be of
good variety, of firm fibre, in a healthy growing
state; with a stout stem, in proportion
to the height, <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
with numerous side branches, and with a root rather
large in comparison to the part above ground.</p>

<p>Our author’s mode of preparation of turfy peat-moss
soils for planting we think good, but conveniently
applicable in heathy moss ground, only with
the assistance of the late Mr Finlayson’s ingenious
device of the self-clearing plough. At every seven
feet of breadth, Mr Monteath excavates a deep rut,
by means of a plough with three coulters and two
mould-boards,—two of the coulters cutting, each, a
side of the rut, the other dividing it in the middle,
and the double mould-board turning out a furrow to
each side. He passes this plough twice along in
forming the rut, each time turning out from four to
six inches in depth, so that the whole depth of the
rut is about ten inches. These minor drains communicate
with larger ones dug by the spade across
the field. The thrown up slices are then cut into
lengths of eighteen inches, and carefully dried, by
turning and by piling a few together, as openly as
possible, that the wind may blow through. A small
pile, about six in number, is then burnt upon the intended
site of each tree, if necessary, aided in the
combustion by furze or other fuel; taking care, by
proper regulation of the quantity of fuel, or otherwise,
to prevent the combustion
from proceeding too <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
far, and the ashes from becoming white and light,
as in this case a considerable part of their virtues is
dissipated. This ploughing, drying, and burning,
being performed as early in the summer as the weather
will permit, the earth under the ashes is immediately
dug over, from two to four feet in breadth,
and mixed with the ashes, and the following spring
the planting is performed. In situations where Mr
Monteath’s plough could not be worked to advantage,
these minor drains may be formed by the
spade; and in heathy peat soils, not requiring drains,
the burning of the heathy turfs on the site of the
plants might be efficacious in correcting the tannin,
and in reducing and enriching the soil within the immediate
reach of the young plant, which would thus
acquire strength to subdue the more distant part, and
gradually reduce and form the whole into soil capable
of affording healthy nourishment.</p>

<p>We also approve of the plan mentioned by Mr
Monteath, for covering with timber, rocks or stony
ground, so bare of soil as not to admit of planting,
by means of placing seeds in the crevices, or on the
shelves of the rock, and scraping together a little
mould to cover them; or, when practicable, placing
the seeds in the middle of the mould. Here,
however, we think he errs,
in recommending the <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
cutting down of the young resulting shoot, year after
year, that the plant may acquire long roots, extended
down the crevices, to give the future stem
stability and sufficient foraging. We would never
cut down but when the plant appeared stunted, and
not then in succession, nearer than three or four
years from the last cutting. Those who possess
rocky precipices, so steep or inaccessible that the
above method of our author could not be practised
with conveniency, may cause a quantity of the
cheapest seeds of trees be sown down over the top
of the crags during the winter: we would prefer the
end of January, as the mouldering effects of the
frost and the rains would cover numbers of these, so
as they would come to vegetate.</p>

<p>Mr Monteath advises, in rearing oak-forest or
copse, to put in only about thirty plants per acre,
and by layers from these to cover the interstices.
In order to recommend this practice, he states the
celerity with which these could be extended, layer
beyond layer, making steps, every second season, of
eight or nine feet, by relaying the last layer’s shoots,
and he affirms, that a forest could be sooner, and more
economically raised by this means, than by planting
the whole at first. This is sufficiently imaginative.
He seems not to be aware of the fact,
that life is <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
very languid, and growth slow, in any branch horizontally
extended, especially when upright stems
from the same root are suffered to remain. He also
expects the layer-roots to become strong and capable
to forage for large trees. That they will, in
the oak, ever become so, we think very improbable.
Examination of the roots which proceed from oak-layers
would place this beyond dispute; if they are,
as we presume, fibrous and slender, similar to those
produced by apple-layers, no tree or bush of any
great size will result. Large trees, generally, cannot
be procured by layers, but only in those semiaquatic
kinds which grow readily by slips. Whether it may
be advantageous to fill up the vacancies of copse by
layers, in preference to seed-plants, experience only
can determine. The bark of trees or bushes raised
by layers or cuttings is generally thicker than that
of those raised from seed:—this might balance some
deficiency of the growth in the case of oak-coppice.</p>

<p>Our author advises the cutting off the upper part
of spruce-trees on the outside of plantations, in order
that their lower branches may extend the more, and
remain vigorous,—thence affording more adequate
shelter to the within plantation. Perhaps it is quite
unnecessary to guard any person from practising this
piece of folly. On the outside
of woods, spruce-firs <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
will retain the branches in vigour, sufficiently low
for all the purposes of shelter: nothing could be
more unseemly than the decapitated trees; and in a
few years most of them would become rotted in the
stem, die, and fall down.</p>

<p>From observing, on the western side of Scotland,
thriving plantations exposed to south-west winds
and sea-spray, and also to north-east winds and sea-spray,
in woods extending along the western side of
the salt lochs in Argyllshire, our author predicts,
that, under his panacea of repeated cutting down,
trees would grow luxuriantly in exposed situations
on the north-eastern margin of our island. We do
not desire to see Mr Monteath’s sanguine hope
turned to disappointment, which a trial would certainly
effect. There is something peculiarly hard
and cutting in our <i>vernal</i> north-eastern breeze fresh
from ocean, which withers up the tender spreading
leaves of every plant raised from the ground, and
placed in its immediate draught. This is occasioned
as well by a cold moist, as by a cold dry wind, the
new vegetable structure in the developing process,
when the tissues of tubes and cells are only in the
state of pulp, and all the molecular germs floating
into figure, under the direction of vital and chemical
impulses and attractions,
being very susceptible <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
of derangement. We attribute this effect on vegetables
principally to the coldness and saline matter.
The depressing effect on the spirits or vital energy
of man, occasioned by the eastern breeze, does not
appear to be dependent on the same cause. The
great rivers, the Rhine, the Weser, the Elbe, independent
of the English rivers, throw a great quantity
of decaying vegetable matter into the lower
part of the German sea, which, being there only a
shallow muddy gulf, may thence have its waters so
far contaminated as to throw off pernicious exhalations.
Or, what is much more probable, the eastern
breeze, sweeping along the swamps (at this time in
high evaporation, of malaria) which extend from
Holland upward, and along the whole southern
shore of the Baltic, and thence eastward nobody
knows how far, must bear these exhalations, uncorrected,
over the narrow sea which intervenes between
these flats and our shores. It is even likely
that a slight diffusion of saline matter from this
gulf, instead of correcting, may have the opposite
effect, as a small quantity of salt tends to promote
putrefaction. It is evident that this miasma-atmosphere,
borne across the German sea, is not pernicious
to vegetables; as, when the breeze is not too
cold, or too violent, they progress
rapidly in growth, <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
and acquire a deep green colour: and, on the north-eastern
Scotch coast, where timber suffers most, the
breeze has little of that depressive influence on man,
although it may derange his respiratory and transpiratory
organs; while down on the shores of Suffolk
and Essex, where the malaria of the breeze is
greatest to man, the exposed trees receive less injury.
Yet something may depend upon the electric
state of this air, or upon the greater pressure of
the atmosphere, which, we believe, are connected. On
the exposed east coast, when it is desired to grow
timber, we must estimate the most enduring kind of
tree, perhaps sycamore plane, and place it to seaward,
covering it as much as possible by wall, and
planting other kinds under its lee. We have noticed
several instances where timber throve well,
without shelter, close by the sea, on our north-east
coast, which we attributed to a diminished draught
of the eastern breeze, owing to the configuration of
the adjacent higher country.</p>

<p>Mr Monteath ascribes the sickliness and decay
which, in many places, is perceptible in the timber
of narrow belts, to the want of shelter, and recommends
to form belts wider. There is some truth in
this, and the advice is good, although he does not
seem to be aware of the whole cause
of the evil. <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
Trees in single rows thrive latterly much better
than in narrow belts, because, from the planting,
they are habituated to open situation, and acquire
roots, branches, and stem, suited to this: whereas
trees in narrow belts, from being in a thicket while
young, acquire great length of stem, and roots and
tops unproportionably small; and, when thinned out,
and from the narrowness of the belt, exposed nearly
as much, as, though in single row, they become
sickly, from delicacy of constitution unsuited to this
exposure, and from deficiency of roots to draw moisture
commensurate to the increased evaporation.
To obviate this evil, resulting from narrow belts,
timely thinning, so as to retain numerous side-branches
downward to the ground, of course, should
be adopted. In a drier climate, or in high and exposed
situation, continued forest will have great effect
in promoting the luxuriance and health of timber;
but in the southern part of Scotland, there are
few situations, keeping away from high elevation
and the eastern coast, where any of our common
trees would prosper in forest, which would not grow
pretty well singly, provided the plant be allowed
from the first to accommodate its figure to the situation.</p>

<p>Mr Monteath’s system of
pruning severely while <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
the trees are young, we think very prejudicial; and
his restricting pruning to trees under 15 or 20 feet
in height, equally erroneous. About 15 years ago,
we selected a number of young trees several years
planted, and low and bushy, in an open situation. We
treated one half of these in a manner similar to what
our author inculcates, pruning away most of the
lower branches, and also any irregular top ones: and
the other portion, though very bushy, we left to nature’s
own discretion, merely correcting several which
threw up more than one leader. The result has
been, that those much pruned up have required constant
attention to the top and repeated pruning, they
continuing to break forth into irregular branches and
numerous leaders, and thence have sustained considerable
loss of growth; while those let alone, after
hanging several years in bush fashion, of their own
accord have thrown up fine leaders, which now form
beautiful, upright stems, with sufficiency of regular
lateral branches or feeders, requiring little or no attention;
while the original bush at the ground, from
the size and overshadowing of the superior tree, appears
now so diminutive as to be unworthy of notice.
We do not mean to inculcate that pruning is superfluous;
on the contrary, when judiciously executed,
under regulation of the purpose for
which the <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
particular kind of timber may be required, it is highly
useful: but the cutting off and diminishing the number
of lower feeders, thence deterring the growth of
the tree, and encouraging the superior feeders to
push up as leaders; or to increase in size so as to render
their removal, should it be necessary, dangerous to
the health of the tree, and the upper part of the stem
useless from large knots (a practice which in nine
cases out of ten is followed), cannot be sufficiently
reprobated. <i>In pruning, every means should be
taken to increase the number of feeders</i>, in order
that none of them may become too large; and no
healthy regular feeder should be lopped off till the
tree has reached the required height of stem, and a
sufficient top above this for the purpose of growth;
at which time the feeders upon the stem, as far up
as this necessary height, may be removed<a class="afnanc" href="#fn36" id="fnm36">36</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Monteath states that Scots fir should not be
thinned to greater distance than 20 feet apart, and
larch 15 feet. This shews very little consideration:
the distance apart necessary for these kinds of timber,
and of all other kinds, must be relative to the
soil, situation and climate, and the intentions of
the owner, whether he means to bring them soon to <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
market, or carry them forward to great timber.
When fir trees are intended to be early cut down,
or when disease in larch from unfitness of soil may
be apprehended, as it is thence of small consequence
though their future ability to become great timber be
destroyed by closeness, the plants should be retained
pretty near each other from the first, that
the timber may be tall, straight, and clean. On the
other hand, when the soil is suitable and great timber
intended, early attention to thinning and great
openness from the first is absolutely necessary, as
they (the firs), different from other trees, can never
repair the loss of their lower branches by throwing
out new ones from the naked stem; and double the
distance stated by Mr Monteath at least for larch,
which, instead of less, needs more space than Scots
fir, will be required. We believe the decay of Scots
fir, occurring so generally at about 40 years of age,
although also dependent on inferior variety and
kiln-drying of cones, arises principally from want
of timely thinning; that is, that the infirm variety
of Scots fir in common use, when supported by numerous
feeders, and not weakened by being drawn
up into a tall slender stem, will often have hardihood
to continue growing, and acquire considerable size in
our cold, wet, moorish tills, or even
in our moorish <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
sandy flats. Many casualties will, however, occur
among resinous trees<a class="afnanc" href="#fn37" id="fnm37">37</a>, especially in unsuitable soil,
even when the plants rise from the seed naturally
sown, and have sufficient room for lateral expansion.
The same cause, viz. closeness or want of thinning,
induces early maturity, old age and decay in larch,
although it does not seem to have any influence,
either as inducement to, or prevention of, the rot.
We have heard men,—even men reasonable on
other subjects—speak of allowing a pine wood to
thin itself: as well might a farmer speak of allowing
his turnip field to thin itself. When woods
are planted of various kinds of timber, the stronger,
larger growing kinds will sometimes acquire room
by overwhelming the smaller: but when the forest
is of one kind of tree, and too close, all suffer
nearly alike, and follow each other fast in decay,
as their various strength of constitution gives way;
unless, from some negligence or defect in planting, a
portion of the plants have come away quickly, and
the others hung back sickly for several
years, so that <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
the former might master the latter: or when some
strong growing variety overtops its congeners. In
the natural forest of America, when a clearance by
any means is effected, the young seedlings, generally
all of one kind, spring up so numerous, that, choaking
each other, they all die together in a few years.
This close springing up and dying is sometimes repeated
several times over; different kinds of trees
rising in succession, till the seeds in the soil be so
reduced as to throw up plants so far asunder as to
afford better opportunity for the larger growing varieties
to develope their strength; and, overpowering
the less, thus acquire spread of branches commensurate
to the height, and thence strength of constitution
sufficient to bear them forward to large trees.</p>

<p>Mr Monteath, apparently to encourage the destruction
of young oak, and keep his merciless hatchet
agoing, asserts that “oak trees, at the age of 24
or not exceeding 30 years, have as thick a rind or
fleshy part of bark, as when they arrive at 50.” If
by this he means to say, that the useful part of the
oak bark of the stem of a tree at 50 years old is no
thicker than that of one of 30, we say he is wrong,
widely wrong. A thriving oak tree of 100 years will
still continue to increase the thickness of the valuable
part of the bark on the stem, although
part of the <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
outer layers or cuticle may lose vitality, and become
<i>corky</i>. We have taken down a luxuriant growing
oak, exceeding three feet in diameter, the living bark
of whose stem was about two inches in thickness, resembling
thick plank, and which was considered by
the tanners much stronger in quality than bark of
younger growth. Has Mr Monteath seen any bark
resembling this on 24 years old sproutings? If, by
the above quotation, our author means to say, that
the valuable part of the bark on the branches of a
tree 30 years old, is equal in thickness to that on the
same sized branches of a tree at 50, we say he errs
still; that is, provided the older tree be in a healthy
thriving condition, and growing equally open and
exposed as the younger. Trees, as they increase in
years, increase also in the thickness of the living
bark, from the root upwards to the smallest twig,
provided they have not begun to get dry and sickly
from over maturity. When this period arrives, the
living part of the bark upon the stem and larger
branches becomes very thin, with a great proportion
of dead corky substance; although, on the twigs and
smaller branches, it still continues to thicken. The
age at which the external part of the bark begins to
lose vitality, is considerably dependant upon luxuriance
of growth, climate, and exposure;
and the <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
period when this loss proceeds faster than the annual
increase within, is altogether dependent on the vigour
of the tree, not on the age, and never takes
place till the timber is ripe for the dock-yard.</p>

<p>We would warn the readers of Mr Monteath’s
volume, that his calculations and statements regarding
the worth of coppice and timber generally, seem
more suited to flatter the owner’s wishes than to be
useful to him as a merchant; or to be adjusted to
the value of money during the late war—not to the
present value. We also do not very well comprehend
his re-establishment or resuscitation of life in
dead trees. We observe several other slight errors,
such as the duration of his paling,—and the affirmation
that the sap-wood will not extend so as to cover
over the section of a pruned branch which contains
any red or matured wood. Most readers will be able
to detect such errors as these.</p>

<p>In taking leave of Mr Monteath’s volume, we
would offer our acknowledgment for the attention
he has bestowed on the subject of the seasoning
of timber, by steaming with extract of wood (pyroligneous
acid) and by scorching, as prevention of
dry rot. The greatest objection we see to his plan
is, that all timber dried quickly is liable to crack and
split, and loses a considerable portion
of its <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
toughness and elasticity; at least, timber when dried
slowly is harder and stronger than when dried quickly,
the dryness in both cases being carried to the
same extent. The comparative strength of timber
scorched and timber not scorched, after both are
soaked in water, as in the lower timbers and plank
of vessels, should be subjected to experiment.</p>

<p>Our author’s directions (although the practice is
also not new) to season larch by peeling off the bark
one or more years previous to cutting, in order to prevent
it from warping or twisting in framed housework;
and his hints recommending stripping off
the bark from most kinds of timber a season previous
to cutting, are also deserving of notice. We
greatly wonder that something efficacious has not
been done in regard to dry rot by our Navy Board,
and consider the subject of such importance, that we
think a rot-prevention officer or wood physician
should be appointed to each war vessel from the time
her first timber is laid down, to be made in some
shape accountable if rot to any extent should ever
occur; and that this officer should be regularly bred
to his profession at an institution established for the
study of this branch of science at the King’s largest
building yard. Perhaps it might be as well to endow
several professors’ chairs at the
universities to follow <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
out and lecture on this science, as being of far more
importance than many which are already endowed.
We think that steeping in fresh water pits for several
years, till a kind of acetous fermentation take place
in the timber, or till it become of a blue colour; or
in tan-pits; or for a shorter period in strong brine
pits; or even salting the timber like herrings, after
it is blocked out; or forcing pyroligneous acid, or
composition of chlorine, or other solution, antiseptic
or obnoxious to life, into the pores of the timber
when dry, by pressure; or perhaps by charring the timbers
after they are cleaned down on the stocks ready
for the plank, by playing on them a jet of flame from
a flexible gas pipe,—might, some of them, be found
preventive of the rot, and at same time not to impair
any of the valuable qualities of the timber.</p>

<p>We are a little shy in committing ourselves, lest
we should be impressed as a dry-rot physician or
professor; but if the following plan for preservation
of vessels when unemployed has not already been
tried, we recommend it to the notice of our Navy
Board.</p>

<p>Let every part of the vessel be cleared out, and
every port-hole or external opening be made as air-tight
as possible.</p>

<p>Let a quantity of
recent-burned limestone <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
(lime-shells) be spread thin over every inside deck or floor,
and over the whole bottom and sides of the vessel,
and every door or hatch in the main-deck be immediately
closed down air-tight. A number of rods
or shreds of timber would require to be nailed slightly
to the inside skin of the ship where the slope is
considerable, in order that the lime-shells may rest
and not roll down.</p>

<p>As soon as it is found that the lime-shells are
completely slaked—become hydrate of lime—let it
be sold to the farmer or house-builder, or be used in
any government erection going forward at the time;
and let another quantity be laid in. We would
consider a sloop of 80 tons load of lime, value, prime
cost and freight, about L.70, would suffice for covering
the internal surface of a seventy-four gun ship.
When slaked to powder, the lime might be disposed
of at little loss. It is impossible, without trial, to
say how often the lime would require renewal, but
we think twice or thrice a-year would suffice to preserve
the vessel dry and free of any corruption; perhaps
even once might be found effectual. Suppose
that the lime was renewed every four months, and
that when slaked it only sold at two-thirds of the
whole cost, the preservation of a line-of-battle ship
would be nearly as follows. The price
of the lime <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
and work is correct, according to the rates in most
of the harbours of Scotland.</p>

<p>The complete efficacy of lime-shells in preventing
dry-rot is already proved—the coasting small craft
frequently employed in the carriage of lime-shells
not being liable to it. All that requires to be ascertained,
is the minimum quantity which will effect
it; and if the expense of this quantity will greatly
exceed the average loss by dry-rot
in our unemployed <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
shipping. If the quantity necessary be not greater
than what we have supposed—even Mr Hume himself
would not consider the expense extravagant—the
preservation of a line-of-battle ship not exceeding
that of one of our numerous army <i>captains</i> while
lying <i>in ordinary</i>.</p>

<p>Lime is preventive of dry-rot in several ways,—when
uncombined as an antiseptic, simply by drying,
from its attraction for water; by its causticity,
which remains for a number of months after it is
slaked, destroying organic life; and by its absorbing
putrescent gases. It is not easy, without trial,
to form a correct estimate of the quantity of moisture
which would enter through the inside planking
of a man-of-war; but were the bottom of the vessel in
good condition, the pumps attended to, and external
air excluded, we should consider that the moisture
would not greatly exceed 60 tons of water yearly,
which would nearly be required to convert 240 tons
of lime-shells into dry hydrate of lime. No very
great injury or inconvenience would be produced
by the opening of the seams of the ceiling (the
inside skin), or of the inner decks or floors, or by
the warping of the plank, resulting from the contraction
of the timber by the dryness; but the caulking
of the main deck would require to
be looked to. <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
No danger from fire need be apprehended, from the
sudden slaking of a thin layer of shells, even though
a leak in the main deck should occur. The thickness
beyond which shells could not be suddenly
slaked upon dry boards without danger of fire,
might be tried.</p>

<p>It is necessary to mention, that, though lime-shells,
or dry hydrate of lime, when timber is so dry as to
be liable to corruption by insects or by dry rot, is, by
destroying life and increasing the dryness, preventive
of this corruption; yet lime, in contact with timber
for a considerable time in very moist air, from its
great attraction to water, draws so much moisture
from the air as to become wet mortar or pulp, which,
moistening the timber, promotes its decay by the
moist rot.</p>

<p>This volume, which ought to have been named
Sang’s Nurseryman’s Calendar, is a work of very considerable
merit and usefulness, where the craft of
the common nurseryman is plainly and judiciously
taught. The editor, Mr Sang, admits that he was
very little indebted to the notes of his friend (the
late Mr Nicol) for the matter of the volume; and
the work itself bears evidence of this, being principally
devoted to the operations of the nursery, the
sowing and planting of hard-wood trees, which are
described with a judgment and accuracy attainable
only by long experience in that line, to which
we understand Mr Sang belongs. Every person engaged
with the sowing, planting, or rearing of timber,
if he be not too wise or too old to learn, should
forthwith procure this volume.</p></div>

<p>Mr Sang recommends sowing of forests in preference
to planting, which many before him have done,
we believe, more from conjecture that nature’s own
process must be superior to any method of art, than
from any experience of the fact
or accurate <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
knowledge of—at least without giving sufficient explanation
of, any cause rendering the tree of more puny
growth in consequence of being transplanted. In
the case of simple herbaceous vegetables, we find,
on the contrary, that transplanting increases the
size, protracts the period of full development, and
retards the decay, the individual suffering no lasting
injury from root fracture, or that injury being more
than compensated by change to a new and more recently
wrought soil; or even the root fracture, instead
of being of prejudice to the growth, by throwing
the energy of the plant in this direction to repair
the injury, not only may do so, but delaying the superior
process towards reproduction<a class="afnanc" href="#fn38" id="fnm38">38</a>, may
also give a <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
new vigour to the soft fibrous rootlets, and greater extension
than they otherwise would have attained. But
in regard to some kinds of compound plants of perennial
stem, transplanting, especially when the plant
has attained some size, by fracture, throws the main
wide diverging roots into numerous rootlets and slender
matted fibres, none of which has individual
strength to extend as a leader far beyond the shade
of the spreading top, thence forage in a drier, more
exhausted soil, and, from consequent want of supply
of moisture, the sap of the tree stagnates into flower,
or merely leaf-buds, instead of flowing out into new
wood. The fibrous softer rooting vegetables sustain
no lasting injury from root-fracture and transplanting;
but the harder, more woody, larger growing
roots, losing their leader, never entirely recover their
original power of extention. Yet we think that one
or two year old plants, taken from the seed-bed,
would suffer little or no injury from removal, as the
<i>tap-root</i>, which is ultimately of no consequence,
never constituting a leader,
but eventually <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
disappearing, is the only part which suffers fracture in
the woody state; and the side shoots, which become
the grand root leaders, are in the fibrous state, which
easily repairs small injury. These observations refer
only to certain kinds of timber trees. The willows,
poplars, and lindens, succeed better when their roots
are cropped in near the bulb when removed. We
planted a piece of trenched ground, partly with poplar
plants, with good roots, from a nursery, and partly
with poplar loppings, about the same size as the
plants, stuck into the ground: the loppings grew
more luxuriantly than the nursery plants. The
same occurs with willows—with this difference, that
willow-loppings do better with the top entirely
cropped, without any twigs or external buds; the
poplar only pruned a little, with a terminal bud left
on every twig, especially on the top shoot. The superiority
of the growth of those without roots, results
from their having fewer buds and twigs to exhaust
the juices before the formation of new fibrils to
draw from the ground, these few buds thence continuing
to push more strongly, and from the roots
growing more vigorously when sprung anew, than
when they are a continuation of the wounded deranged
old ones.</p>

<p>New rootlets spring out much sooner and more <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
boldly from the thick vigorous green stem bark, than
from the delicate tender root bark, and also more
vigorously from the bark of the bulb than from the
bark of the remote roots, of those soft-wooded trees;
indeed, it appears to be owing alone to the great
strength of the vitality of the bark of the stem, that
those kinds are so capable of continuation by cuttings.
The roots have nearly the same delicacy of those of
other kinds of trees, and show no particular readiness
to throw up sprouts when bared.</p>

<p>Mr Sang, in furtherance of his advocated scheme
of raising forests <i>in situ</i> from the seed, sensible of
the general impracticability of fallowing or working
the ground all over previous to sowing, gives directions
for pitting or stirring the earth the previous
spring and summer, in spots about fourteen inches
square, and from six to nine feet separate, burying
the turf under the soil, in order that it may be rotted,
and a fine friable mould obtained for reception
of the seeds to be sown the following spring; several
seeds are then deposited in each spot, equidistant;
these require to be hand-weeded the first season,
and the resulting plants hoed around for several
successive years, till they have mastered the weeds,
after which they are all plucked out but one (the
most promising) in each spot. This is
all very well, <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
if we could have patience and assiduity to proceed
thus systematically; and if the mice, birds, and other
enemies, would “let them be;” but although this
plan, when a braird is obtained, and the tufts
cleaned, and seasonably thinned, is probably the
best, yet landlords, in general incapable of exertion,
but under the excitement of a fresh thought, are so
infirm of purpose; tenure of life and property are so
precarious; and trusted servants, especially when
the procedure has originated with another, are so
liable to be negligent, that our amateurs ought to
gratify their passion for improvement while it lasts,
and proceed at once by purchase of plants, and pitting
or slitting, which procures them a forest immediately
palpable to view. There is no doubt, however,
that wooing the soil to kindliness, rearing the
infant plant from the germ, and superintending <i>a
principio</i> the entire beautiful process of vegetable
development, will afford a deeper charm to a patient
lover of nature; and that the continued solicitude
and attentions required during this process acting
upon man’s parental instinct, will excite an interest
hardly to be felt towards a child of adoption.</p>

<p>A nursery gives such facility to the rearing of the
plants, that, taking into account the greater chance
of failure by sowing <i>in situ</i> than
by planting, the <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
latter practice will be executed for one half the expense
of the former. Supposing that the progress,
after twenty years’ occupancy of the ground, be equal
in both cases,—at which period, however, we think
the transplanted would still have the advantage,—it
would require a considerable ultimate superior
progress in those sown, to outbalance the accumulating
value of the extra expense. It is probable a
combination of both practices might be advantageously
followed—sowing the soils and situations most
suitable, and transplanting the thinnings of these
into the more exposed unpropitious places<a class="afnanc" href="#fn39" id="fnm39">39</a>. The
matter, however, must, after all, be left to the test of
experiment in a variety of soils and situations.</p>

<p>This volume, being principally a monthly detail of
a nursery practice, which has supported the test of
competition, has, on this account, a very different credit
and value from much that has been published of
landlords’ practice, theorists’ conjectures, or adventurers’
quackery. The burthen of our author’s song,
which, from the nature of the work, falls to be repeated
at several of the calendary periods, and which perhaps
cannot be too often repeated, is nearly as follows.</p>

<p>Procure good seed of the best varieties from large
healthy trees, and preserve these in
husk in dry <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
well-aired places till sowing; with the exception of
ash keys, haws, holly-berries, roans, and yew-berries,
which require to be put in the rot-heap as soon as
gathered. The rot-heap consists of seed mixed with
sandy earth formed into a layer not exceeding ten
inches in thickness; this is turned several times before
midwinter, when it is covered with a layer of
earth about seven inches deep, to exclude the frost.
After remaining in this heap one year—till September,
or the following February, these seeds are sown
out.</p>

<p>Sow seeds of trees during the last half of February,
March, or April, on beds of high manured
easy soil, in very fine tilth, and clear of weeds, such
as follows hoed green crop, in distance and depth
in proportion to the size of the seed, or rather of
the annual stem or braird. To deposit the seed at
an equable depth, the upper friable mould is pushed
(cuffed) off the bed to the interstices between by the
reversed head of a rake, as deep as necessary; the
seed is then deposited by the hand, and rolled over
by a very light roller to fix it, that it may not suffer
derangement by the return of the earth which is
then evenly <i>cuffed</i> back from the sides, and no harrowing
or raking given.</p>

<p>Watch most narrowly, and ward off
or destroy all <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
kinds of vermin, mice, snails, birds, till the time
when the rising braird has disencumbered itself of
the husk of the seed thrown up by the ascending
stem, and nip out every weed as soon as discernible
by the naked eye. In order to diminish the toil of
watching, the different kinds should be sown as near
the same time as their nature renders prudent, and
the seed-beds be situated as near each other as circumstances
will admit.</p>

<p>At the end of the first or second season, according
to size and closeness of plants, remove the seedlings
from the bed to nursery rows, at any time when the
leaf is off, and the ground sufficiently dry not to
poach; before April for deciduous trees, and during
April for evergreens, placing them in rather open
order, either by dibbling or laying, according to the
nature of the root, firming the plants well in the
ground; in case of dibbling, taking good heed to
leave no vacuum of hole under the root, and to work
the tool so as to compress the earth more below than
above.</p>

<p>Keep the soil loose and friable on the surface, and
clear of weeds between the transplanted rows by repeated
seasonable hoeings, and let the plants rise
with a single leader.</p>

<p>After the plants have stood one or
two years in <span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span>
the nursery-row, remove them to their ultimate destination
with as little fracture or exposure of root
as possible,—the larger rooted by pitting, and the
smaller by slitting, or as the nature of the soil may
require; paying most particular attention to plant
the dry ground early after the leaf has dropped,
and the moister and more adhesive soils in succession,
as they become so dry in spring as not to adhere
to the tools in working, or poach in treading
the plant firm in; removing the evergreens earlier,
or later, in April, according to the dryness or moistness
of the ground; dipping the roots in a clay-puddle,
and endeavouring to seize the opportunity
of planting before a shower, should the spring be far
advanced and dry, especially in the more arid situations.</p>

<p>Stout healthy seedlings, one or two years old, may
be at once removed from the seed-bed to their place
in the forest, and will often succeed as well as when
nursed in rows, as above.———We have preferred
the pick of the seedlings to the common run of the
transplanted, as being probably stronger growing
varieties.</p>

<p>In cases where it is practicable, work over the
new plantations for several years with crops of potatoes,
turnips, lettuce, &amp;c., manuring
the ground, if <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
possible; and then sow out with perennial rye-grass
and white clover, if the trees are not become a close
cover, making economical use of the grass as early
in the season as it can be mowed with a short
scythe.</p>

<p>For seeds that require to lie a season in the rot-heap,
such as ash keys, haws, &amp;c. September-sowing
is preferable to deferring it to the following spring,
as they are liable to chip in the heap. If not sown
in September, they must be got in as soon in February
as possible.</p>

<p>Acorns, Spanish and Horse Chestnuts, are best
sown when they drop from the tree; but when the
seed is not procured till spring, the sowing ought
not to be deferred beyond February and March. The
best soil is a deep rich loam.</p>

<p>Elm-seed may be sown in June, when it is new
from the tree, or carefully dried and kept over season
till next spring; one-half may then be sown in
March, and the other in April, as the March-sown
is sometimes injured by late frosts. The utmost
care is required to prevent this seed from heating
when newly gathered.</p>

<p>Beech braird is also liable to be cut off by spring
frost; the seed should therefore be sown partly in
March and partly in April, to
diminish the chance <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
of entire failure. The soil requires to be rich, and
is benefited by a dressing of well-made manure previous
to sowing.</p>

<p>Sycamore Plane braird also suffers by late frost,
and for greater security ought also to be sown partly
in March and partly in April. Planes require
dry, poor, rather exposed sandy soil, for seed-bed; as,
in rich damp soil, the top of the annual shoot does
not ripen: the seed ought to be thinly sown.</p>

<p>Birch and Alder seeds require to be sown in
March, or beginning of April, on very fine, rich,
easy mould, giving them very slight cover, especially
the birch.</p>

<p>The Coniferæ, Scots Fir, Spruce, Silver Fir, &amp;c.
should be sown in April, on very rich easy soil. The
greatest care is required to deposit these different
seeds at proper regular depth, from an inch to the
fourth of an inch, in proportion to the size of the
seed.</p>

<p>Larch should also be sown in April; it succeeds
best on the clean mellow ground which has produced
a crop of seedling Scots fir. It is worthy of remark,
that the larch seedlings and row-plants are liable to
die under a putrescent disease, when much recent
manure is employed.—We remark this accordance
with its tendency to putrid disease
in after life. <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span></p>

<p>Acorns, Chestnuts, and other large seeds, may be
economically sown in drill: where the soil contains
much annual weed seed, this admits of expeditious
cleaning by the hoe. Ground which has borne a
crop of potatoes the preceding season, is unfit for
seed-beds, as the tubers and seed of the potato give
much trouble.</p>

<p>These are the chief of Mr Sang’s directions on
raising timber-plants. With the exception of kiln-drying
of cones, and being rather too prodigal of
manure to the seed-beds (perhaps necessary in a sale
nursery), we see nothing in the volume to censure.—A
premium should be offered for a convenient plan
of distributing fir-seed suitably in the seed-bed,
without the aid of artificial drying.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to state, that, in the
culture of trees, there are thousands of incidental
circumstances to which general directions will not
apply, and which demand a discriminating judgment
in the operator: this acts as a school to the mental
acumen; and there is no class of operative men,
which has the faculties of attention, activity, discrimination,
and judgment, more developed, than nurserymen
and gardeners,—whose diversified labours,
requiring, at the same time, constant mental and
corporeal exertion, keep up a proper balance of the
human powers. <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span></p>

<p>We leave to the judgment of the operator to proportion
the thickness of sowing of the different kinds
of seed to the expected size of stem and leaf, under
regulation of soil, season, and quality of seed; and
to determine whether the plants may be continued
more than one season in the seed-bed, or be entirely
or partly drawn the first, which must depend on
their luxuriance and closeness; also to notice if all
the seeds have vegetated the first season, or if many
of them still be inert; in the latter case, the seedlings
must be picked out; to facilitate which, the earth
may be gently raised by a three-pronged fork, with
as little superficial disturbance as possible.</p>

<p>In nurseries, the great and general error is having
the plants too close together, particularly in the row.
Every nursery-row plant should be of a regular cone
figure, with numerous side-branches down near to
the root, and gradually widening in the cone downwards.
These would, indeed, occupy more space of
package, and probably not please the ignorant purchaser,
who generally prefers a clean, tall body; but
they would support the hardships of removal to the
moor, and be stately trees; when the comely, straight,
slender plants would either have died altogether, or
have become miserable, unsightly skeletons, or stunted
bushes. <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span></p>

<p>In cases where plants are required of considerable
size, for hedge-rows or park-standards, it is matter
of doubt, how far frequent removals in nursery, or
cutting of roots, is profitable. This occasions fibrous
matted roots, which tend much to the success of the
ultimate removal, and to the growth of the plant for
several years after; but, by checking the disposition
the roots naturally have to extend by several wide-diverging
leaders, probably unfit the plant for becoming
a large tree.</p>

<p>Mr Sang remarks that sycamore planes and birch
should not be pruned in the latter part of the winter,
as they bleed greatly at that season: we have often
noticed this as early as midwinter, which also occurs
to the maple tribe. Our author introduces the
mountain-ash as a forest tree, a rank it by no means
merits, at least for value as a timber tree. When
exceeding six inches in diameter, it is generally rotted
in the heart, and is only valuable as a copse for
affording pliant, tough rods; or twigs, as a charm or
fetiche against witchcraft! It is, however, one of
our most beautiful trees.</p>

<p>Mr Sang gives directions for kiln-drying fir cones
previous to thrashing out, or extracting the seeds.
We have before adverted to this,
and would <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
particularly reprehend the practice. It is difficult to determine
how far early fruitfulness and consequent
infirmity of constitution, diminutiveness of size at
maturity, and early decay, may originate from kiln-drying
the cones; but, from the same process of
drying in a less degree having been ascertained to
induce early seed-bearing in the case of other seeds,
we may infer almost to certainty, that the coniferæ
of this country, not naturally planted, are very materially
injured by this practice.</p>

<p>It is of small consequence, in reference to the tree
itself, at what season deciduous trees are planted,
provided they be naked of leaf, and the ground not
too dry, as they are not liable to lose much by desiccation
or evaporation by the bark alone, before the
roots strike anew in spring, and draw freely from the
soil; and the skin of the bulb, although the small rootlets
be broken, sucks up moisture from the damp soil
to repair the loss by superior evaporation: but evergreens—firs,
hollies, laurels, yews, sometimes suffer
by removal at a time when the roots do not immediately
strike, as in winter, owing to the torpor from
cold. We have often seen their juices exhausted,
and their leaves entirely withered, by a continuation
of dry northerly winds, the manifest
cause of which <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
was the great superficial exposure of the leaves evaporating
faster than the fractured torpid roots afforded
supply. Therefore, although winter planting
seldom fails, yet it is perhaps better to seize the
exact time in spring, immediately before the roots
commence to strike anew, before there is any new
top-growth, and while the soil and air remain somewhat
moist and cold, that the evaporation may not
be too great. In this climate, April is a good season
for removing evergreens to the field, although, to
throw the work from the busy season, it is often
practised in the nursery in September, when their
annual growths are completed, and while there is
yet warmth to enable the roots to strike anew; this,
however, is only advisable where the soil for their
reception is in the most favourable state, friable, and
inclining to moist, or when there is great indication
of rain, and the air near the dew point. Of course
they require to be planted as soon as extracted. In
winter or spring, when it happens that evergreens
must lie in the <i>shough</i>, the most protected situation,
where the air is moist and still, ought to be chosen,
and the earth carefully closed to their roots, which
is best done by watering, if rain be not expected;
the stems and branches should also lie as close to the
ground as possible. <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span></p>

<p>There is appended to this valuable Planter’s Calendar
a treatise on the Formation and Management
of Osier Plantations. As this will not bear
compression well, we refer our reader to the volume
itself.</p>

III. <span class="smcap">B<b>ILLINGTON</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">ON</span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>LANTING.</b></span></h3>

<p>We have perused Billington’s account of the management
of the Royal Forests with much profit;
it affords us an excellent series of experiments, shewing
how much conduct and integrity may exist in
Government establishments, even although the strictest
watch be <i>not</i> kept over their motions by the nation
itself. Words are awanting to express our admiration
of every thing connected with the management
of our misnamed Royal Wastes. We scarcely
could have hoped to find such pervading judgment
and skill of calling, as have been displayed by the
Commissioners, and Surveyors General and Particular;
but it is true, the noble salaries attached to
these situations must induce men of the very first
ability and knowledge of the subject, to accept of
the office.</p></div>

<p>Our author, Mr Billington, proceeds with great
naiveté to relate how they sowed and resowed acorns—how
they planted and replanted trees, persevering
even to the fifth time, sometimes covering the roots,
and sometimes not, “but all would not avail,” nothing
would do; the seeds did not
vegetate, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
plants refused to grow, excepting in some rare spots,
and a few general stragglers. Then how the natural
richness of the soil threw up such a flush of vegetation—of
grass, and herbs, and shrubs, that most of
these plants were buried under this luxuriance; and
how the mice and the emmets, and other wayfarers,
hearing, by the <i>bruit</i> of fame, of the wise men who
had the governing of Dean, assembled from the uttermost
ends of the island, expecting a millennium in
the forest, and ate up almost every plant which had
survived the smothering. Now, this is well; we rejoice
over the natural justice of the native and legitimate
inhabitants of the Royal Domain, the weeds
mastering the invaders the plants, who, year after
year, to the amount of many millions, made hostile
entrance into the forest. We only deplore the cruel
doom of the mice, on whose heads a price was laid,
and of the emmets, who, acting as allies of the native
powers, merited a better fate than indiscriminate
slaughter.</p>

<p>May we hope that our Government will no longer
persist in unprofitable endeavours to turn cultivator,
or to raise its own supply? We laugh at the Pasha
of Egypt becoming cotton-planter and merchant
himself, in a country where the exertions of a man
enlightened beyond his subjects,
who has influence <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span>
to introduce intelligent cultivators, possessing the
knowledge of more favoured nations, may be necessary
to teach and stimulate the ignorant Copt to
raise a new production: And here, where discovery
in every branch of knowledge almost exceeds the
progressive—here, where so many public and government
<i>fixtures</i> stand out, as if left on purpose to
indicate the recent march of mind, contrasting so
strongly with private and individual attainment in
science and art,—with every thing the reverse of what
affects the Egyptian’s conduct; or, at least, with no
excuse beyond affording a cover for a wasteful expenditure
of the public money;—will our Government
continue the system, heedless of reason or ridicule?
or will they not at once end these practices, and immediately
commence sales of every acre of ground to
which the Crown has claim, excepting what is necessary
for the use of royalty, abolishing Woods and
Forest Generals, Rangers—every one who has taken
rank under Jacques’ Greek, or the devil’s own invocation,
and pay off a part of the debt which is crushing
the energies of the first of nations?</p>

<p>Yet it is not of individuals that we complain;
perhaps nobody could have had a stronger <i>desire</i> to
do his duty, than the late Surveyor-General. It is
the system that is naught; where, to
the lowest <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
labourer, none have individual interest in the success
of their work; and where the efforts of the really
honest, intelligent, and industrious are, by directions
and trammels, rendered unavailing; or even through
misrepresentation by <i>those</i> of a contrary character,
(as would seem in the case of Mr Billington), are the
cause of dismissal.</p>

<p>We can only predicate of the future from the past.
In spite of all our Parliamentary acts respecting
these forests, and the clamour that for ages has been
made about them, they, with little exception, have
existed only as cover for sinecure expenditure, or for
display of tyro ignorance and incapacity, and subject
for pillage, thieving, and frauds of every description<a class="afnanc" href="#fn40" id="fnm40">40</a>;
(<i>vide</i> Parliamentary Reports). We could
easily—by a very simple incantation, requiring a rod
neither tipped with silver nor with gold, but merely
a plain cane or sword—bring forth a sufficient quantity
of large growing oaks to meet any emergency.
Our charm would be to give the title of Prince to
the Duke who should possess, and have at the command
of Government at a fair price, a certain <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
number of oaks above a certain size, and a step of elevation
to every titled person, and the title of Baronet
to every private gentleman, who should possess a
given number, diminishing the number requisite to
give a step as the title became lower. We should
conceive this law would not render nobility of less
estimation. Perhaps the clause might be added,
that one tree raised on waste ground should count
two.</p>

<p>As a treatise on the rearing, or rather prevention of
the rearing, of young planting, Mr Billington’s small
volume possesses some real merit; and simplicity and
useful and sagacious remark are so blended together,
as to afford to the reader at once amusement and information.
We are something at a loss to account
for this incongruity. Has the seclusion of a forest
life given a cast of the <i>naturel</i> to his mental product;
or has Jaques of Arden really been in Dean
with his celebrated invocation?</p>

<p>Mr Billington’s directions on pruning and training
are generally good; but he distances common
sense when on his hobby of shortening of side
branches, in recommending to extend this practice to
pines. His breeding as a gardener, and consequent
taste for espalier and wall-training, where every shoot
must be under especial direction, seem
to have <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
unfitted his mind to expand to the comprehension of
nature’s own process of action, and disqualified him
from walking hand in hand with her. We also consider
that no good, but rather evil, would result from
continued cutting in, and lopping off the points of
the branches of all kinds of trees, excepting when the
plants were stunted, or much covered with flower-buds.
Even a very slight clipping greatly retards the growth
of hedges; and the labour and attention requisite
would be very great: besides, the poor things, the
trees, trimmed to the Billingtonian standard, would,
amongst the unrestrained beauties of the forest, be
ready to sink into the earth for very shame of their
<i>formal deformity</i>. He errs, too, in recommending
not to plant sycamore plane, as being of little value
while young. We have sold young planes, six or
seven inches in diameter, at a higher price per foot
than large oak. They will generally find a good
market wherever machinery abounds, and will probably
become every year in greater request.</p>

<p>Mr Billington is particularly solicitous to render
his instructions as plain as possible, in describing the
mode of pruning young oaks in formation of knee
timber, as he confesses to bring it down to the comprehension
of gentlemen; but he is not very happy
in his figures of oak trees trained to
this use, from <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
want of acquaintance with the cutting out of naval
crooks. He remarks that “larches are more liable
to die in wet ground by their roots being soaked in
water during winter, than oak and some other kinds;”
but ground that is at all pervious to water, ought
not to be planted till it be drained in such a manner
that water will soon disappear from shallow holes;
and where, from the plastic closeness of the clay,
draining is not quite effectual, the planting should
take place as late in the spring as the breaking of
the buds will permit; and principally by slitting,
which, by not breaking the natural coherence or turfiness
of the soil, affords less opening for water to
stagnate around the roots, and does not occasion the
soil to sink down into the mortary consistence consequent
to pitting; there is also less destruction of
the vegetables growing in the soil, hence less putrescent
matter to taint the water that may stagnate
round the roots; pure water, or water in motion, not
being detrimental to the roots for a considerable
time: also, when the plants are put in late in spring,
there is seldom long stagnation of water that season,
and by next winter the ground has become so firmed
around the roots as to allow very little space for water,
and has also acquired a certain granular arrangement
akin to polarization
or crystallization, which <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span>
allows the water gradually to percolate; it is also
bored by the earth-worm, and other insects, and the
plant itself, after the roots have struck anew and the
fractures healed, possesses a vitality which better
enables it to withstand the exclusion of air from the
roots, and chilling by the water the ensuing winter,
and either prevents absorption of the stagnant
fluid, or counteracts its putrid tendency. Planting
succeeds best in soil of this description when the
ground has been under grass for some period, at least
the new planted tree, in this case, is less liable to the
root-rot; and trenching or digging previous to planting
is of more utility, as the turfiness prevents the
clay from sinking down into impervious mortar, and
allows the water to percolate to the drains.</p>

<p>Mr Billington is very earnest in recommending
to drain well at first, and to keep the drains (open
drains) in repair; he also directs, where the ground
is very impervious and wet, to take large square
sods, about 18 inches square and 9 inches thick,
from the drains while digging in early winter, and
place one of these, the grassy side undermost, in the
site which each plant is to occupy. In the spring,
by the time of planting, the sod has become firmly
fixed, and the two swards rotting afford an excellent
nourishment to the plant, which is
inserted in the <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
centre of the sod, with the roots as deep as the original
surface; the drains, being necessarily numerous,
afford turf sufficient for all the plants. This
is good. He also gives sensible directions to beat
down, hoe, or cut away all weeds, shrubs, and grass,
from the young plants, and to remove all rough
herbage and thickets of shrubs, that form harbour
for the short-tailed mouse, which is exceedingly destructive,
in the case both of planting and sowing;
in the former, by nibbling the bark from the stem,
and biting off the twigs of the young trees, (from
which our author may have taken the hint of cutting
in, as mankind took that of pruning from the browsing
of the ass), and gnawing their roots immediately
below the surface of the ground; and in the latter,
by devouring the seed in the ground, and cutting
down the seedling annual shoot. He also instructs
to keep the tree to one leader, shortening all straggling
large branches; but his assertion, that plants
which had the tops of the straggling branches pinched
off in the first part of summer, grew much larger
in consequence, looks rather absurd; although we
have known a part of a hedge, clipped a week or two
after the growth had commenced in spring, grow
more luxuriantly than the part which had been
pruned in the same manner before
the growth had <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
commenced. This was owing to the check by the
late clipping, throwing the period of growth into
warm moist July; what was earlier clipped performed
its growth in dry June, and was considerably injured
by the manna blight which the latter escaped<a class="afnanc" href="#fn41" id="fnm41">41</a>.
The same cause operates to induce late sown grain
and wheat, which has been thrown late by much
injury of spring frost, to acquire a larger, more luxuriant
bulk, than that of earlier growth.</p>

<p>It would appear to us that Mr Billington, from ignorance
of the value of larch, and of the soil proper for
maturing it, has done more injury to the parts of
the royal forests where a growth of timber was obtained,
by cutting out the thriving larch, than will
be compensated by his pruning and training of the
sickly stunted oak which remained, as described by
him, scarcely visible, when the larches were of size
for country use; but we forget; no blame can attach
to him—his orders were, that every thing should
give place to oak. <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span></p>

<p>In parting with our author, it is but just to state,
that we consider many may profit by a perusal of
his pages: that notwithstanding the simplicity to
which we have alluded, there is often something
sterling in his remarks and reflections, the result of
much experience, resembling the original freshness
of our writers before writing became so much of a
trade. In some places, indeed, his narrative is so
simply, naturally descriptive, and speaks so eloquently,
of ignorance of climate, season, soil, circumstance—of
all the unknown dangers and difficulties incident
to <i>their</i> new employment—and of the wonderful
contrivances and inventions hit upon to remedy
them—that, when perusing it, we could scarcely persuade
ourselves we were not engaged with Robinson
Crusoe.</p>

<p>The <i>surgery of trees</i>, which this author has the
great merit of almost perfecting, is the only important
matter in this volume. His composition salve,
on the merits of which he expatiates so much, and
for the discovery of which he received a premium
from the collective wisdom of the nation assembled
in Parliament, is, however, a piece of mere quackery;
and all the virtue of his practice lies in the cutting
out of the dead and diseased parts of the tree, thus
effecting for vegetables by excision, what nature herself
performs for animals by suppuration, exfoliation,
and absorption.</p></div>

<p>Mr Forsyth’s surgery is of slight importance to
timber trees in respect of economy, as with them as
with man, it is generally easier to raise up anew than
cure the diseased. Yet it is well that the rationale
of this practice be understood by foresters, more in
regard to prevention than cure; an occasion will however
sometimes occur where a tree may economically
be benefited by surgical aid: and in
cases where the <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
Dryades acquire lasting attachment to particular objects,
the science is invaluable, as the object of their
love may be thus continued flourishing to the end of
time, or as long as the inamorata chooses to pay the
surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr Forsyth presents us with numerous models of
knives, irons, and gouges, suited to the operation of
removing the dead parts of his patients. Where
the gangrene occurs in the outside, he hews and
scrapes away with these till every portion in which
the vital principle is extinct be detached, and the
surface all regular and smooth, so scooped out as to
afford no hollow where water may rest. He then
gives a coating of his composition salve to all the
space operated on, wherever the cuticle of the bark
has been broken, which prevents the drought, rain
or air, from injuring the bared parts till the bark
spread over it. In cases where the removal of all
the dead part at once would endanger the stability
of the tree, he first removes it along the borders of
the decayed part all round, close to the sound bark,
of such a breadth as to give full room for the bark to
spread over in one season, and covers this with his
pigment, annually repeating the cutting out, and
painting around the rim or edge of the new-formed
bark, till the whole of the dead part
be cleared away. <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
Under this treatment, the excavation is gradually
filled up with the new wood forming under the
spreading bark, and the wound becomes cleanly cicatrized.
Mr Forsyth has effected complete renovation,
where the sound vital part consisted only of
a narrow stripe of bark and alburnum upon one side
of the stem, and where two cart loads of the diseased
trunk had been scooped out.</p>

<p>When the heart of the tree is decayed, he makes
a section longitudinally in the side of the tree, as
far up and down as the rot extends, and of sufficient
width to admit the working out the diseased part;
and managed as above, the bark and wood gradually
extend from the two sides of the section into
the vacuity, and fill it up entirely with new sound
timber. When the tree is of considerable diameter,
the opening formed in the side of the stem must be
wide, nearly extending to half the circumference,
otherwise the sides of the section would meet before
the bark extended over all the inside. When
the bark from the two sides approaches to touch in
the bottom of the hollow, he pares off the cuticle
from each side where they join, in order that they
may unite thoroughly. Should any of the roots be
diseased, he removes the earth, and pares away the
corrupting parts; and if the top be
stunted or <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
sickly, he crops it at the joints where the smaller
branches separate, whence numerous fine strong
shoots spring forth, whose new vigour of vegetation,
and absence of drain by seeding for several years,
generally renovate the whole plant, and occasion the
filling up of the wounds (should the trunk be under
cure) to proceed rapidly.</p>

<p>Need we mention, that it is only in the cases
where the partial death or decay has resulted from
casualty, or something not connected with the general
system of the plant, or with the soil, or other
external circumstances (unless these can be changed),
that renovation by clearing away the decayed or
sickly parts is attainable? Where the plant is sinking
from mere old age, a source of decay of which in
some kinds at least we have doubts, or from the soil
being improper or exhausted for the particular kind
of plant by long occupancy, or from any circumstance
not admitting of remedy, the attempt to heal up the
wounds caused by cutting out the diseased parts, or
to induce new vigour by cropping the top, must be
abortive, or only attended with partial or temporary
success.</p>

<p>Our author, who is a practical man, apparently
very little disposed to throw away time upon inquiring
into causes, does not attempt even
to guess at <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
the mode by which his composition performs the
wonders for which he gives it credit. It is impossible,
by any salve, to promote discharge from the
bare alburnum, though cut into the vital part, to
form, or assist in the formation, of bark; and the
sum of the resulting advantages consists in preventing
the vitality from becoming extinct far inward
from the section (as under the best management to
a certain extent it will become so), by an antiseptic
cover from the drought and moisture, heat and cold;
in promoting the spread of the juices from the edge
of the bark over the bared part by exclusion of
drought, and by forming a defence against insects.
We have found a paste of pure clay, wrought up
with some fibrous matter, as chaff or short hay, an
excellent cover for tree wounds, applied in spring or
early summer, when dry weather followed the application;
but in autumn or winter, and when moist
weather followed, the clay, by remaining wet, only
served to induce corruption. We think this clay
paste (probably benefited by a powdering of charcoal
on the inside) the best application when applied
in spring. We have seen a terminal cross section,
of about one inch diameter, of a long branch, covered
quite over in two months with bark when
clayed; and a tree of three inches
in diameter, from <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
which a dog had torn off the bark from one half of
the circumference of the stem, entirely renew the
lost bark in one season, when immediately clayed
over. Resins, oils, bitumen, paints and composts
without number, have been used with more or less
success, depending upon the period of the year, weather,
kind of tree, individual health, and other circumstances;
but these salves should, as in flesh-wound
salves, be considered only as protections, or
slightly auxiliary to the restorative energy of nature,
not as cures.</p>

<p>Having by chance glanced over a pamphlet by
an Englishman, a Mr Withers, we find there has
been jousting between that gentleman and our Scottish
knights, backed by their squire the Edinburgh
Reviewer, in which the discomfiture of the knights
has been wrought by simple hands.</p></div>

<p>It seems Sir Henry Steuart, forgetful that his own
bright fame, which rivals that of the discoverers of
steam-power and gas<a class="afnanc" href="#fn42" id="fnm42">42</a>, though of comparatively quick
growth, will endure for ages; and led astray, probably,
by the foolish adage, “soon ripe, soon rotten,”
had stated unqualifiedly, that “fast grown timber
will sooner decay, and is of opener weaker texture
than slow grown of the same kind;” and on these
false premises concluded, that all culture or application
of manure to further the growth of timber is
improper—winding up with some patriotic flourish
about danger to our war navy, from Mr Withers <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
rendering the British oak of such exceedingly rapid
growth as to be soft and perishable as mushrooms.
Withers completely demolishes his literary and scientific
adversaries, but is, withal, so very imperfectly
acquainted with the subject—himself, and also his
junto of experienced correspondents, that we shall
attempt a few lines in elucidation.</p>

<p class="padtopa">We shall first state our facts, accompanied with
explanatory remarks.</p>

<p>No. 1. An ash tree of about 18 inches diameter,
and 65 years of age. The first 35 years, the annual
growths were of middle size, and the timber weighty
and tough; the following 15 years, very small, light,
porous, and free; the latter 15 of middle size, and
of fair quality. This tree had been growing till
about 49 years of age in a grassy avenue, of dry
clay soil, and close by a deep ditch. About sixteen
years back, the ditch had been filled up, and the
ground ploughed and manured regularly till the
tree was cut down. After 35 years’ growth, the
scorching roots of the ash had rendered the soil so
dry, that the tree had run entirely to reproduction:
<i>Nearly all the nourishment from the ground assimilated
in the leaves being expended in forming
seed, no extension of the top had
taken place, and</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
<i>thence no thickening of the bole being necessary
for support, no wood proper had been deposited
on the trunk save the annual rings of lineal tubes
to convey the sap, which constituted a brittle light
wood, of very slight lateral adhesion</i><a class="afnanc" href="#fn43" id="fnm43">43</a>. After the
ditch was filled up, and the surrounding ground
ploughed and manured, the increased supply of moisture
and nourishment had induced a considerable
new extension of top (which was quite visible in fine
young healthy branches rising from a stunted base),
and consequent necessary thickening of stem by annual
layers of proper dense wood, along with the
lineal annual tubes.</p>

<p>No. 2. A beautiful most luxuriant growing oak,
in one of the sweetest sunny spots of the sweetest
valley of our Highlands. This tree, of nearly
two hundred solid feet of timber, and 80 years
of age, was growing upon the bare shelf of a
sound mica-schist rock. From underneath this
shelf, several feet down in front, a most exuberant
spring welled out, and the roots
spread down over <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
the rock to the mouth of the crystal spring, no
doubt tracing inward the course of the limpid waters
into the rocky chambers of the Naiad. We
had much conjecture how this tree came to be growing
on the bare shelf, and finally concluded, that the
nymph of the spring, while she sat there gazing on
her beauties, under the varying dimpling reflection
of the living waters, her rosy feet bathed by the
glassy flood, had been surprised by some rude Celt,
and to effect escape from his rough embrace, had
been transformed by Diana into a tree. Yet whether
of natural or supernatural origin, it was by the
people of the glen held of miraculous virtue, and
the sickly children were brought to be dipped in
the spring after being borne several times round the
charm-tree. When torn from its seat, the tree,
though sound, and having a level fall (we saw it
fall), broke across about twenty feet up, where the
stem was about eight feet in circuit; <i>this was owing
to the very soft tender nature of the wood, which,
although consisting of very large annual growths,
was, when sawn out, the most porous insufficient
Scots oak we have ever seen</i>. As this fact may be
ascribed to the supernatural,—the heart of the
nymph beginning to soften towards the Celt at
the time Diana interfered,
accounting well for <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
the soft texture of the heart-wood of the tree, we
shall not press it as a proof on either side of the
controversy. Perhaps sober reasoners may think
this all phantasy, and conclude, that the tree, from
deficiency of substantial earthy food, and subsisting
principally on <i>slops</i> (being mainly nourished by
drinking of the delicious well), would, like an animal
under similar circumstances, be of soft flabby
consistency.</p>

<p>The above fact is opposed to common opinion—a
Highlander always choosing his oaken staff from off
a rock, as being most to depend upon; yet perhaps
this preference is owing to some association with the
hardness of the rock itself.</p>

<p>No. 3. We found a sycamore plane (Acer pseudo-platanus)
in the same row with other sycamores, and
about the same size, so exceeding hard that it could
scarcely be cut down by mattock and hatchet, whereas
the others adjacent were comparatively of moderate
hardness, though differing considerably in hardness
from each other; the soil in this case was very
equable, being of Carse clay. The peculiar hardness
of this tree could only be attributable to a
harder variety. Indeed, the difference of quality in
timber depends chiefly on the infinite varieties existing
in what is called Species, though
soil and <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
climate have no doubt considerable influence, both in
forming the variety, and in modifying it while
growing. Of varieties, those which have the thinnest
bark, under equal exposure, have the hardest wood.</p>

<p>No. 4. We have cut a number of large old ash trees,
and found, with one or two exceptions, of what is called
thunder-struck trees (which we consider only an
obdurate variety), that they were invariably of very
free, weak consistency, more especially the latter
formed growths, but even the earlier growths had
become <i>frush</i> from age. This timber soon went to
decay after being cut down:—one piece cut out into
planks, and these being laid down in the order they
occupied in the log, was in the course of some weeks
rendered again entire by being agglutinated by
Jew’s ears (a species of fungus.) The workmen were
greatly startled at the fact, thinking the log bewitched.
When immediately dissevered by wedges,
the wood was so much decomposed, that its fibre
was tenderer than the Jew’s ears, separating in a
new course in most places, in preference to the saw
draught occupied by the ears. We have found very
old oaks have exactly the same friable character, so
much so, as render their safe felling almost impossible;
yet this oak timber had not lost
much in weight <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
when compared after being dried with younger
oak.</p>

<p>No. 5. We cut a row of ash trees, about 50 years of
age, in dry Carse clay, by the side of a deep ditch,
and consequently of slow growth; the timber was
excellent, hard, strong, and weighty, rather most so
where the size was smallest. At one end, where the
row approached a brook, and the soil became richer
and moister, several of the trees were of good size,
but rather inferior in quality of timber, excepting
one (the largest, though not the nearest to the
brook), which was of very hard, strong, and reedy
fibre, evidently a variety differing much from the
others. It is always easy to discriminate pretty accurately
the quality of the wood, by examination of
the saw cross section of the trunk, that is, provided
the same saw be employed, and be kept equally
sharp; the best timber having the glossiest, smoothest
section.</p>

<p>No. 6. We have examined Scots fir grown in many
different situations; by far the best quality, of its age,
of any we know, stands upon a very adhesive Carse
clay, which, from the proprietor’s neglect, is all winter
and in wet weather soaking with water, and the trees
not of very luxuriant growth. These, till a few years
ago, stood in close order, without
the stem being <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
much exposed to parching or evaporation; this exposure
of the stem rendering fir timber much
harder and more resinous. Every body who has
touched larch must be convinced that the slow
grown on poor <i>tills</i>, especially with long naked stems
in exposed situation, is very much stronger and
harder than the quick grown, though often not so
tough: but much depends on the variety in larch,
those having the reddest matured wood being much
harder than the paler coloured.</p>

<p>Memel fir, which is the largest growthed red
pine we are acquainted with, is
very strong and durable, probably next to the pitch
pine of North America; yet the very large growthed
Memel is generally weakest, though we frequently
find a log of small growthed, mild and inferior
in strength. In old buildings we have often witnessed
the beautiful small growthed red wood pine
wormed, when the larger growthed was sound, but
we are sensible that spontaneous decomposition and
consumption by insects are very different; much resin
deters insects, whereas, in moist situations, as in
treenails of vessels, it conduces to spontaneous decay;
yet is it preservative when the timber is exposed
to the weather by
excluding the rain. <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span></p>

<p>The coniferæ differ much in the internal arrangement
of their woody structure from the hard wood
species, having tissue of much larger cells, and being
generally destitute of the large lineal tubes,
which in hard wood constitute the more porous inner
part of the annual layer. When these tubes
occur in the pines, they also differ in position, being
in the outer part of the layer. Owing to the resin
of the pines becoming fixed in the cells of the outer
part of the annual layers, inspissated, we think, by
the summer’s heat and drought (others say congealed
by the cold), these cells are filled up, and this part
of the growth rendered much denser than the inner
part of the layer, being from solidity semi-transparent.
We would attribute the abundance of
resin in the Georgian pitch pine to the heat and
long summer of that country, probably in concert
with damp richness of soil, not only occasioning this
deposit under these circumstances, but perhaps inducing
a disposition in this species to the formation
of this product<a class="afnanc" href="#fn44" id="fnm44">44</a>. The absence of the large tubes, <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
and the presence of oleaginous resin, render pine timber,
when old and small growthed, not so brittle, nor
so liable to decay, as that of deciduous trees; but it
becomes very deficient in lateral adhesion. From the
same cause we find the external layers of matured
pine timber comparatively superior to the quality of
the inner layers: in hard wood the exterior layers
are generally much inferior to the inner. Boards of
sap-wood of fast grown Scots fir, particularly of the
outside layers are much better suited—stronger and
more lasting, for boxes used as carriage packages,
or for machinery or cart lining much exposed to
blows and friction; than boards of the best matured
red wood of Memel, Swedish, or Norway pine. This
is principally owing to the fast grown alburnum
possessing much greater lateral adhesion than the
matured wood of old pines. To have these sap-wood
boards in greatest perfection, the tree must <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
not lie in the bark after felling, and the boards must
be well dried soon after being cut out. To expose
the tree, peeled, either standing or felled, to the sun
and dry air for some time, will considerably increase
the strength of this alburnum. The wood, while in
the state of sap-wood, of many kinds of timber is as
strong and much tougher than the same wood after
being matured, and would be equally valuable were
any process discovered of rendering it equally durable;
its insufficiency often arises from partial decay
having occurred while in the log. The same sap-wood
of oak, which, allowed to lie on the grass after
being peeled in spring, will be so much decomposed in
autumn that it may be kicked off with one’s heel;
if cut out and dried immediately on being felled, it
will be tougher than the matured, and, kept dry as
cart-spokes, and defended by paint from the worm,
will last and retain its toughness for an age. The
tilling up, which to a certain extent occurs in maturing,
is most probably deposited to fill up tubes,
and may thus not greatly strengthen the mass;
a hollow cylinder being stronger than a solid cylinder
when extending horizontally over a considerable
stretch, like a joist or beam; the mass may also become
a little more fragile by maturing: besides a filling
up is the result of some
chemical change the <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
wood probably becoming slightly carbonized or approaching
to that change which takes place when
vegetables become peat.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to speak of the strength of timber,
as different kinds of timber, and different parts
and qualities of the same kind of timber, have different
kinds of strength. Some kinds are stronger as
beams or joists, other kinds as boarding; while, again,
some kinds are better for enduring a regular pressure,
others for supporting a sudden jerk or blow,
either as beams or boards. Some kinds are also
comparatively stronger, moist; others when dry—and
some kinds retain their qualities of strength or
toughness longer than others when moist, and
others longer when dry, although no rot appear.</p>

<p>No. 7. Purposely for experiment<a class="afnanc" href="#fn45" id="fnm45">45</a>, we selected three
ash trees, all growing in Carse clay, but differing the
most in fastness of growth of any we could discover.
We cut these down on the same day; two of them
proved about 36 years planted, and the third 15;
this, the youngest was of fast growth, and had
layers of more than double the size of one of the <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span>
former, and about six times that of the other. We
cut a number of pieces of exactly equal length and
thickness (17 inches long, and nearly an inch on
the side), from each of these, choosing them of clean
straight fibre, at equal distance from the ground,
and from the outside of the tree, and having their
growths nearly parallel to one side, of course free of
heart. We proved one of each immediately on being
cut out while full of sap, with their growths on
edge in horizontal position, supported at each end
with a weight suspended from the middle. The smallest
growthed, and the largest, weighed at the time of
trial nearly equal; the medium growthed one-thirtieth
more. The smallest growthed supported the weight
about six minutes; the medium and the largest
about half that time; the smallest growthed yielded
the least before breaking, and the largest yielded
the most. When completely dried, the weight of
the medium growthed still continued greatest, surpassing
the largest one-fourteenth, and the smallest
about one-thirtieth. The smallest and medium supported
nearly equal weight, during equal time, and
outbore the largest about one-seventh<a class="afnanc" href="#fn46" id="fnm46">46</a>; when placed <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
with the growths on edge, they were stronger than
when placed with the growths flat.</p>

<p>After these rather lengthy references to facts, we
must allude to a circumstance which we are astonished
has not been attended to by Mr Withers, and his
gentlemen correspondents connected with His Majesty’s
docks,—the not taking into account the place
of the tree whence the portion of wood for experimenting
the strength had been taken, and also how
the annual layers stood, whether horizontal or on
edge, or around a centre, when the weight was applied.
The experienced and accurately practical
Mr Withers presents two specimens of oak, the one
of faster and the other of slower growth, to Professor
Barlow, of Woolwich Royal Academy, and the
strength of these specimens is tested and reported
upon, without once alluding to what we have mentioned
above. Now, if this has not been attended
to, the experiment may be considered a test of
something else than of the timber. How much
the strength is affected by the place of the tree,
any person may satisfy himself by proving one
piece of timber taken from near the root, another
half way up the tree, and a third near the top:
he will find that in a tall tree the comparative <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
strength will sometimes vary as much as 3, 2, 1;
that is, a beam, say 2 inches square, and 4 feet long,
taken from near the root, when horizontally placed,
and resting only at each end, will support three
times as much as a like beam in like position from
near the top of the tree, although both are equally
clear of knots or cross section of grain. This is particularly
manifest in large fast-grown silver fir and
old ash, and the difference is always greatest in old
trees. He will also find that the position of the
beam, in respect to the layers being circular round
the heart, flat, on edge, or at an angle, has considerable
influence, and, should he inquire farther, will
perhaps notice, that the timber from different sides
of the tree is not always alike strong; that one specimen
of timber will be superior to another, both being
moist, and inferior to it when both are dry, and that
also, as in No. 1, the tree at the same height on the
same side, will contain timber differing in strength
fully one half, and not always diminishing in strength
from the heart outwards, even in hard wood. We
are well pleased with one gentleman of the Navy
Dock-yard, who naively admits, that he is incompetent
to decide on these subjects, having been altogether
devoted to the mathematical, in estimating
the strain and resistance timber
suffers under <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
different combinations. Now we like this division of
labour.</p>

<p>But to return to our subject. The facts stated
go to prove, that the quality of timber depends much
upon soil, circumstance, and more especially on variety;
and that in the early period of the growth of
trees, before much seeding, and when the soil is not
much exhausted of the particular pabulum necessary
for the kind of plant, that rather slow grown
timber is superior in strength to quick grown, especially
when the quickness exceeds a certain degree;
when this degree is exceeded, the timber is not so
weighty, and is well known not to be so durable.
However, when timber is required of considerable
scantling, it is only in good soils, where the tree
increases moderately fast, that timber will attain
sufficient size for this, at an age young enough to
retain its toughness throughout, or to continue
forming firm dense wood on the exterior. This is
particularly so in the case of hard-wood timber, more
especially when oak grows upon a moist soil, where
the matured wood, of brownish-red colour, is often
unsound, and where decay commences at a comparatively
early period. In the pine, owing to the oleaginous
undrying nature of the sap
(resin), the <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
timber retains its strength to a great age; and the
reedy closeness of slow growth, for most purposes,
outbalances any loss from deficiency of lateral adhesion.</p>

<p>Moderately fast grown timber is much more
requisite for naval purposes than for other uses; as,
besides the greater longitudinal strength when of
large dimension, it has greater adhesion laterally, is
far more pliant, and therefore much better suited
for the ribs of vessels, where cross cutting a portion
of the fibre, from the inattention to training to proper
bends, is unavoidable; and whence a disrupting
shock (which is rather to be withstood than fair
pressure), makes the unyielding splintering old wood
fly like ice; the rift commencing its run from the
cut fibre. For plank, the lateral adhesion and pliancy
of young moderately fast grown timber is
equally valuable, especially for those which are applied
to the curvature of the bow and stern. Young
timber also softens much better by steam, therefore
is more convenient for planking, and for being bent
for the compass timbers of large vessels. The vessel
constructed of it will besides, from the general
elasticity of the fibre, be more lively in the water,
sail faster, and, though stronger
to resist, will <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
have less strain to endure<a class="afnanc" href="#fn47" id="fnm47">47</a>. Mr Withers’s corresponding
friends, especially those of his Majesty’s
Dock-yards, with the good common sense of
practical men, are well acquainted with all this, although
they get a little out of element when they
meddle with nature or causes. Mr Withers is himself
equally out of element when he expatiates on
the mighty advantage of trenching and manuring
at planting, and when he talks of our Scottish holes.
The Knight, too, is still more at fault in dreading
any great influence on the quickness of the growth
of trees from this gentleman’s <i>new inventions</i>,—and
doubly at fault, from conjecturing our navy would
suffer from being constructed of the fastest grown
British timber there is any chance of our shipwrights
obtaining. Since we were in our teens, we have almost
every season trenched a portion of ground for
planting, and have manured highly at planting<a class="afnanc" href="#fn48" id="fnm48">48</a>, <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
and for several years afterwards. We have found,
when very adhesive subsoil was brought upward,
that the trees throve <i>well</i> while the ground continued
under cultivation; but when the labour ceased,
they were soon overtaken by those planted at the
same time without trenching. This comparative
falling off was evidently owing to the surface being
rendered more adhesive by the gluey plastic subsoil
being mixed upward with the original small portion
of surface-mould. This new surface melted to a
pulp by the winter rains, when drought set in
spring, run together, became indurated, and parting
into divisions, admitted the drought down to the
unstirred ground by numerous deep and wide cracks,
which rent the rootlets of the trees, and rendered it
impossible for any plant to thrive. There are also
many kinds of light subsoil, which it would be folly
to bring to the surface, and where little profit would
arise from deep stirring, even though the surface
were retained uppermost.</p>

<p>In cases where the plants were very small, we have
found deep trenching of no benefit, but in certain <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
soils rather hurtful, even during the first years; but
with larger plants, such as are often used in England,
it invariably occasioned their roots to strike
quickly, by affording a regular supply of moisture,
and from being easily permeated by the rootlets,
expedited the growth, yielding much early luxuriance
when followed by skilful culture, but latterly,
seldom to such a degree as would lead us to suppose
much difference would be discernible at 30 years of
age, between the trenched and those planted by
mere pitting, slitting, or sowing,—much more depending
on proper draining, on young, thriving,
small sturdy plants, of best variety,—on suiting the
plant to the soil and climate, and on timely thinning.</p>

<p>But even were a very superior ultimate progress
of growth obtained by trenching, manuring, and
culture of timber, yet as capital and manure will
<i>probably</i> be more advantageously employed in common
agriculture, which gives a comparatively quick
return of both, we shall leave to Mr Withers and
his coterie of illuminati the whole advantage of his
discovery. Economic philosophy is the queen of
our Scottish plants; she will not admit any new
system of nurture for her subjects
without the <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
strictest scrutiny of its utility as applied to her domains,—she
proceeds thus to weigh Mr Withers’s practice:—</p>

<p>Would land under timber 28 years planted,
with growth accelerated by Mr Withers’s practice,
in two-thirds of the available portion of Scotland,
sell at more than L. 100 per English acre? Suppose
that the thinnings previous to the 28th year
would cover the cost of planting, and subsequent
cultivation and attention which
is necessary, besides <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
the cost of the trenching and manuring (in many
cases they would not), the entire value of the land
would be lost. It may be said that the common
rules of utility do not apply in this case,—that the
landlords will not be moved to any other improvement
than planting, and that otherwise their income
would be dissipated entirely, without any portion
being applied to reproductive uses. We grant
all this; but Scottish landlords have very little taste
for the Withers’ system,—to deface their beautiful
wastes, by burying all the fine turf and wildflowers
under the red mortar (the common subsoil), or
to scatter manure. Planting by pitting and slitting
will prove far more attractive; besides, the
means are entirely awanting to carry on such expensive
proceedings to the necessary extent, and the
cultivation of one acre in this fashion would leave
19 untouched, when the whole 20 might have been
wooded, in many cases to equal advantage, by the
money expended on one. We have known planting
executed by contract for one year’s interest of the
above stated first extra expenditure, which we would
match against planting raised by Mr Withers’s process,
in the same situation. There is also a very
considerable proportion of Scotland
very suitable for <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
timber where the stony nature of the surface entirely
precludes trenching.</p>

<p>Mr Withers, who appears to have no general
knowledge of soils and climates, would hold a different
language with regard to Scotland and Scotsmen,
if he saw the beautiful thriving plantations
now rising in that country, planted by mere pitting
and slitting, where, owing to the drought in early
summer being less fierce than what occurs in the
central, eastern, and southern counties of England,
and to the herbage being less luxuriant, planting without
trenching can always be depended upon. Mr
Withers would also have been sensible had he had
much practice in rural affairs, that twenty loads of
putrid manure per acre at planting, although of very
considerable advantage for two or three seasons to
the rising trees, in promoting, along with hoeing and
digging, an early start to luxuriance, would cause
little or no lasting amelioration of the soil; That
the vegetable mould naturally occupying the surface
is generally by itself a much better defence against
the summer’s drought, than when incorporated with
the subsoil, especially after cultivation ceases; that
lasting fertility of ground for timber, though sometimes,
is often not increased by
admixture of soil <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
and subsoil; and that, generally, the luxuriance of
the tree must ultimately depend on the natural
depth and quality of the ground itself.</p>

<p>Mr Withers, with that precise knowledge of the
subject, and clear conception of the nature of things,
which generally accompanies a partial acquaintance
with facts, makes a confident and rather imposing
appearance as a wielder of language and a logician.
From his assumed superiority, we especially wonder
that he should possibly have envy of Scotsmen, which,
from the tenor of his letter, we are constrained to
believe. Need Caledonia remind her noble sister,
England, of their consanguinity,—that they are sisters
whom nature hath <i>twinned</i> together? Is there
another in all the earth, with quadruple the advantages
of Scotland, who can rank with her in science
and literature, arts and arms? And is England
not proud of her poorer sister? Or can they feel
aught but mutual love?</p>

<div class="dctr09">
<img id="hr221" src="images/hr12.a.png" width="72" height="11" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Since writing the above, we have looked over some
experiments by Messrs Barlow, Beaufoy, Couch, and
others, on the strength of timber. These show so
much discrepancy of result, as leads
us to conclude, <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span>
that experimenters have not attended sufficiently to
the structure and nature of the timber, the position
and quality of the different layers, &amp;c. Take, for
example, the stem of a tall tree, 100 years old: At
the cross section, it is found to consist of a certain
number of layers of matured timber, and of sap timber.
These layers having been gradually formed, the external,
after those more internal have partly dried,
and the internal and matured wood being also filled
up to more solid consistency than the external, the
stem, on being barked, contracts in drying much
more externally than internally. As soon as the
surface has dried, the outer layers contracting
laterally
are not sufficient to surround the undried internal
layers, thence split in longitudinal rifts; and
as the drying proceeds inwards, the cracks deepen
till they reach nearly to the heart—these rifts, when
the timber is thoroughly dry, being generally wider
in the sap timber than in the matured, more than
in the proportion of the size of the respective circles.
This effect of drying is what every body is acquainted
with.</p>

<p>Besides lateral contraction, there is also a disposition
to contract longitudinally by drying, much
greater in the external than internal layers. While
the tree is undivided, this greater
contraction of the <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
exterior layers is prevented, by the adhesion to the
drier more filled up central column (which probably
had contracted a little during the formation of the
exterior sap-wood layers), the contractile force of the
exterior balancing equally around this central column.
Should this balance be destroyed by the stem being
cleft up the middle, the longitudinal contraction will
immediately take place, and the two halves will
bend outward, from the outside layers contracting
more than the inside layers. We have seen an ash
tree rend up the middle from the cross section above
the bulb, nearly to the top, on being cut across in
felling,
owing to the longitudinal contractile force
of the exterior existing even before drying.</p>

<p>Should the dried stem of a tree, of considerable
length, be laid hollow, supported at each end, the
outside layer being stretched almost to breaking by
the longitudinal contraction being greatest in the
outermost part, a very small weight, aided by a slight
jerk or concussion, may be sufficient to burst the outside
layer on the lower side, the outside layers on the
upper side not standing out as a support above, but
combining their contractile force with gravity to
rend the lower. As the outer layer gives way, the
strain is thrown concentrated upon the next outermost,
which also gives way, and the
beam is broken <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span>
across in detail. In like manner, when the direct
longitudinal strength is tested, the external circles being
in greater tension than the internal, the tightest
parts of the log will give way in succession, like a
rope with strands of different degrees of tightness;
yet the lateral adhesion of the layers will have considerable
effect in strengthening the mass.</p>

<p>The above explains the fallacy of estimating the
longitudinal strength of a thick piece of timber from
experiments with small shreds; it likewise explains
how a large unbuilt mast is so easily sprung; wherefore
a beam round as grown will be rendered stronger
as a beam by being formed into a hollow cylinder,
by boring out the central part; and also how a
square log will be strengthened as a beam, by cleaving
it up the middle, and placing the two pieces on
edge, with their outside or backs together. In the
latter case, the middle, by being turned outside, and
exposed to the air, will contract more than what it
would do shut up and covered by the exterior wood,
especially if resinous pine timber, which continues
to contract for many years, owing to the resin, when
exposed to the air, gradually drying or undergoing
some change, by which it is diminished in size, and
rendered similar to amber. <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span></p>

<p>Consideration of the difference of tension of the
concentric layers, from the difference of disposition
to contract by drying, modified by the difference of
position in which these layers may stand, when supporting
weights and bearing strain, with the various
qualities of timber of the same kind of tree, from
variety, age, soil, climate, or from being taken from
near the outside or heart, or butt or top, will, we
think, account for the contrariety of results which
unphilosophical experiments have afforded.</p>

<p>We have noticed that a sensation has been produced
in a certain quarter, particularly among persons
of a certain age, by a publication of Sir Henry
Steuart of Allanton, on removing large trees, eked
out by a very clever article in the London Quarterly,
on Landscape Gardening, ascribed to Sir Walter
Scott.</p></div>

<p>It may seem unnecessary to direct the attention of
the public again either to this volume or its subject,
both of which have already engaged the public attention
to a degree greatly beyond their value and importance;
but Sir Henry, with all his foppery and parade
of decorating parks, approaches, and lawns, and
all that sort of chateau millinery, has now and then
risen above his subject, and not only given us several
hints useful in rural economy, but has also pretensions
to have brought out some facts hitherto but
imperfectly known, and to have traced them to general
principles. <span class="xxpn" id="p227">{227}</span></p>

<p>It is curious to remark of how much greater importance
the elder part of society—those upon whom
wealth has at length devolved, are generally held.
Any device, however trifling, which can in any way
divert the fancy, pamper the lingering senses, or
patch up the body of our second childhood, is infinitely
more useful to the discoverer, and meets with higher
patronage and more eclat, than what is of a thousand
times more consequence to the young. Now, if
this were the fruit of filial love, all would be very well—we
would idolize the picture: but when we see these
discoveries only patronized by the old themselves, in
the merest egotism, we blush for our patriarchs, and
wonder if time and suffering will be spent as unprofitably
upon ourselves.</p>

<p>We wonder much what fascination can exist to
a mind of so much ability and culture as that
of Sir Henry Steuart, in decorating a few dull unprofitable
acres,—causing a few bushes and bush-like
trees to change place from one side of a dull
green to the other!—laying digested plans of action,
embracing a great number of years, to accomplish
this very important feat, which most probably the
next heir will make <i>the business of his life</i> to undo,
by turning them back to their old quarters, if
he does not, with more wisdom, grub
them out <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
altogether as cumberers of the soil! For ourselves, we
would rather <i>baa</i> with the silly sheep, and nibble
the turf, than pass our time in acting over this most
pitiful trifling, or in publishing a memorial of our
shame. We know not how others are affected,
but there is no other place on earth where we have
felt such oppression and weariness, as in the extensive
smoothed park and lawns around the country
seat. We sicken under the uniformity of the heavy-looking
round-headed trees,—the dulness of the flat
fat pasture, undecorated by a single weed,—the quiet
stupid physiognomy of the cattle,—the officiousness
of the sleek orderly menial. It may be we are very
destitute of taste in this; here every thing is experiencing
satiety of sensual enjoyment, is full to repletion;
every thing has been sedulously arranged
to please, and we ought certainly to admire; but
we have no sympathy with such a scene.</p>

<p>The solitariness, the absence of men and of human
interest, is not compensated by any of the wild
charms of nature. There is small room here for the
discovery of the <i>habitat</i> and native character of
plants, no chance of meeting with a rare species,
every thing is modelled to art. The land-bailiff is
an adept. With his dirty composts and top-dressings,
he smothers the <i>fog</i> and the
daisy; the scythe <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span>
sweeps down every idle weed, every wild flower which
escapes his large-mouthed oxen. The live smooth
bark of the lush fast-growing trees, affords no footing
for the various and beautiful tribes of mosses and
lichens. The fog-bee has lost its dwelling, the humble-bee
its flowers, and they have flown away. Scarce
an insect remains, except the swollen earth-worm,
the obscene beetle, and the bloated toad, crawling
among the rank grass. There is a heavy dankness
in the air itself. The nervous fluid stagnates under
it,—the muscles relax into lassitude,—inexpressible
depression sinks upon the heart.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the relief we feel when
we emerge again into varied nature beyond the ring-fence,—we
have the hill and the furze, the wild-violet
and the thyme, and all the sweet diversity of
our subalpine flora. We have the thatched, patched
hut, the fine ragged children, the blooming cottage-girl,—we
have the corn-field, where weeds of every
dye, the beautiful centaurea and scabiosa, the elegant
fumaria, the gaudy cock-rose, and the splendid
chrysanthemum, are contending for existence with
the cerealeæ. Look at the broken mound, with its
old picturesque trees and tangled bushes; there is
the ancient root where the throstle had its nestlings,
which are now at large on the leafy
boughs, and are <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
tuning their yet unformed notes to melody. Now
every twig has raised its new column of foliage to
the sun; and branch, and root, and stone, embellished
all over in the richest variety of cryptogamic
beauty, swarm of insect life. This smooth path has
been paved by the lightsome foot; how superior to
the gravel-walk on which the labourer has grudged
his useless toil! Even the cart-ruts possess an interest,
which useful labour has worn. After the smooth
monotony of the park; the turf-dykes, the fluting
of the ridges, the different kinds of crops, are most
agreeable diversity. The dunghil, and chanticleer
among his dames, the toiled horse, the lean milch-cow,
and the superhumanly-sagacious-looking shepherd-colley,—every
thing we behold commands a
sympathy, draws forth a wish of benevolence.</p>

<p class="padtopa">As Sir Walter Scott’s Critique came under our
notice prior to Sir Henry’s Guide, we shall proceed
in the same order.</p>

<p>In the first half of this article, Sir Walter gives
the history, and describes the varied character, of
Landscape Gardening, in a very imaginative and felicitous
manner, which, as depending on genius and
literature alone, was to be expected; but, in the latter
part of the essay, when he comes to
treat of <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
action and facts, and Sir Henry’s <i>discoveries</i>, the deficiency
in practical knowledge and judgment, only
forms a contrast to the fancy, elegance, and erudition
of what goes before.</p>

<p>Sir Walter, apparently not quite unconscious of
the ridicule attaching to the subject,—to this mighty
scientific and historic parade in teaching country
gentlemen to amuse themselves by transferring grown
trees as they list, from one place to another, without
entirely destroying the life of the transported subject,—makes
a curious effort to sustain its consequence,
by pointing out the immense advantages to a district
by the squire’s residing in it; insinuating, that
every thing which may amuse him at home, and thus
induce him to stay, although of itself childish or infamous,
becomes of the highest importance, being
ennobled by the end. The following courtly quotation
is from Sir Walter’s proemial observations:
“A celebrated politician used to say, he would willingly
bring in a bill to make poaching felony, another
to encourage the breed of foxes, and a third to
revive the decayed amusements of cock-fighting and
bull-baiting; that he would make, in short, any sacrifice
to the humours and prejudices of the country
gentlemen, in their most extravagant form, providing
only he could prevail on them to
dwell in their <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
own houses, be the patrons of their own tenantry,
and the fathers of their own children.” Sir Walter
does not attempt to describe or analyze the “humours
and prejudices” necessary to render the above
lures efficacious. Does he infer that such dishonourable
power over their fellow men, or that the
opportunity of indulging in such low despicable
practices, would induce the country gentlemen to sojourn
in their father-land? It is impossible to say
any thing more insultingly cutting. But we are far
from imputing to Sir Walter any intentional offence.
Yet we cannot help being angry with
the freakish favouritism of Fortune, although we
are sensible it belongs instinctively to the female
character, often a necessary and very interesting trait;
how she dooms one man from his childhood to toil
incessantly for a bare subsistence; how she lavishes
her favours upon another, and surrounds him from
the cradle with every delight; the mind enlightened,
the taste cultivated, the body trained to the most
graceful exercises, <i>even whose very amusements</i>
are considered of so great importance as to throw a
high interest upon an art of no earthly utility, but,
on the contrary, where the labour of many workmen
is thrown uselessly away. We are aware that Sir
Walter and his Senator only
regard these pastimes <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
of the country gentlemen, thus highly, through a
reflected interest, the latter in a political view; and
the Baronet, from the known warm benevolence of
his heart (a feeling generally associated with genius),
towards his poor countrymen, to whom he supposes,
in the event of the country gentlemen being by any
means induced to stay at home, a part of the great
land revenue so unjustly wrung from the poor man’s
labour would again devolve.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe with what a flow of imagination
Sir Walter shews off his friend’s inventions—inventions
which have been practised with less or
more success, in a manner very similar, by almost
every planter of note, since the time of Nero. We
quote again: “The existence of the wonders,—so
we may call them,—which Sir Henry Steuart has
effected, being thus supported by the unexceptionable
evidence of competent judges (<i>a deputation
by the Highland Society</i>), what lover of natural
beauty can fail to be interested in his own detailed
account of the mode by which he has been able to
make wings for time?”—“But although we have
found the system to be at once original, effectual,
and attended with moderate expense, we are not
sanguine enough to hope that it will
at once find <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
general introduction. The application of steam and
gas to the important functions which they at present
perform, was slowly and reluctantly adopted,
after they had been opposed for many years by the
prejudices of the public,—earlier or later this beautiful
and rational system will be brought into general
action, when it will do more to advance the picturesque
beauty of the country in five years, than
the slow methods hitherto adopted will in fifty. It
is now found we possess the art of changing the face
of nature like the scenes in a theatre, and that we
can convert, almost instantaneously, a desert to an
Eden.”</p>

<p>Now, this is admirable! Even were it granted,
that no planter before Sir Henry Steuart’s time, or
without his instructions, had ever removed a tree of
considerable size successfully (though we believe he
has nearly as much the merit of discovery in this
as in the other curious invention ascribed to him by
Sir Walter, “making wings for time,” which must
certainly have been performed by Sir Henry a long
while ago, as we remember time flying very well
when we were a truant boy); yet, nevertheless, Sir
Walter, now that his paroxysm of admiration has
had time to moderate, will surely help
us to laugh <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span>
at the absurdity of his hyperbolic figures of comparison,
with steam, and gas, and scenic transformation,
which throw such ridicule upon his excellent friend.</p>

<p>We believe that Sir Henry Steuart has been as
successful as many others of his countrymen in transplanting
grown trees. We have had some little
practice ourselves in this art, but which, had it not
been for Sir Henry’s <i>discoveries</i>, we should not have
thought of obtruding on the notice of the public.
The house we occupied was covered to the south and
west by part of an old orchard of apple and pear
trees, which excluded the drying south-western
breeze, so necessary in a low damp situation. We
transplanted nearly an acre of these, certainly with
more success and economy than could have been effected
by Sir Henry’s practice, the soil being so tenacious,
that it was impossible to remove the earth
from the roots without fracturing all the smaller
fibres. The soil, an adhesive brown <i>Carse</i> clay, contained
a good deal of vegetable matter, to the depth
of about 15 inches, when the subsoil, a close hard
yellow clay commenced, into which very few of the
roots penetrated. This ground had been long under
grass, and the upper soil was much bound together
by the grass and tree roots. Under these circumstances
we adopted the following plan:—<span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span></p>

<p>We first had a stout sledge made, about four feet
square, of lumber pieces of wood, the side pieces
about five feet long, on which it slid, had a small
bend, and extended nearly a foot behind the cross
bottom sheaths, which were sparred over with three
narrow boards. The stout chain of a roller was affixed
to this sledge, when at use, to drag it by. In
the autumn we prepared the site where we intended
placing each tree, by throwing out the earth on two
sides about a foot deep, and eight feet square, and
then dug over the bottom of this shallow pit one
spit deep, and sloped the two other sides, to which
the earth had not been thrown, so that horses could
walk across it; we then took the opportunity of a
slight shower, when the ground was slippery above
and hard below, so that the sledge could easily be
dragged, and set the labourers to work to dig a narrow
trench, two feet deep, and about three feet distant
from the stem (more or less according to the
size of the tree), around those trees we intended to
remove, paying no regard to the roots, but cutting
them right down where they interfered with the
trench, and where the roots in the central part (the
part surrounded by the trench) were not immediately
at the surface, paring off the turf till the roots
appeared. This being done, we caused
them to <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
under-dig and scrape out the clay all round, nearly a
foot inward below the roots, and then to introduce two
large ladders at one side as levers to upset the tree,
the strong end of the ladders being put into the
trench, and as far underneath the roots as to catch
hold firmly, the outer side of the trench being the fulcrum
on which they rested to obtain a purchase, the
light end sloping upward about 14 feet high. Two
men were then employed upon each ladder; one of
them pulled down by a rope attached to the top,
while the other guided the ladder, and rocked it a
little up and down; and, at the same time, several
men hung upon the opposite side of the tree, either
by a rope or the branches, till their united force
upset the tree with a large cake of clay bound together
by the roots, five or six feet square, and perhaps
fifteen inches thick, standing up like a wall,
similar to what occurs when spruce or Scots fir are
upset by high winds, in shallow wet-bottomed soil.
We then removed the ladders, sloped the outer side
of the trench where they had rested, and pared away
the clay from the upset root, till we thought four
horses could drag it, one or two men in the mean
time sitting in the top to prevent the tree righting.
After this we introduced the sledge, pushing it as
far back as possible; if necessary,
cutting holes to <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
admit the ends of the side-pieces of the sledge through
the lower edge of the upset root; and if the tree
were large, placing several wet slippery boards under
the sides of the sledge, that it might be more easily
drawn up the acclivity of the hole. The men hanging
or sitting on the top, then let go their hold, and
the tree generally righted itself, standing fair upon
the sledge as it grew; if it did not do this of itself,
they assisted its rising by lifting at the top. The
root was then secured firmly upon the sledge with
ropes, and the horses were attached, who, by pulling
stoutly, dragged the sledge with its load out of the hole
up the slope, and away to the prepared new situation,
one man walking at each side, having hold of a rope
attached to the top of the tree to guide and steady
it when passing a furrow or other inequality of the
road. The horses were led across the new site, and
stopped when the sledge and tree were in the pit,
about a foot past the berth; the ropes fixing the stool
on the sledge were then untied, and, by pulling
backward upon the ropes fixed to the top, the tree
was upset again upon its side from off the sledge,
and the sledge dragged forward. The tree was then
allowed or assisted to right itself again in its proper
berth, and friable earth packed well around and scattered
over the stool, and a little
litter spread over <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span>
all. The ground was then drained and trenched,
excepting the part around the tree, which had been
stirred in the planting. If thought necessary, a
prop or two were placed to steady the tree during the
winter, as it might otherwise work a little back and
forward with the wind while the clay was moist and
soft. After the earth had dried in the spring, the
props were removed.</p>

<p>When we look back on the description of this practice,
it seems tedious; but much of the work is done
sooner than described. Were it of sufficient importance,
trees might be grown in something like <i>lazy
beds</i>, with water always standing in the dividing
trenches, about fifteen inches lower than the surface,
which would procure roots very manageable by this
practice. We once had a small nursery of oaks so
situated, and the trees which were removed, when of
considerable size, had roots uncommonly matted and
fibrous, and which carried with them a large mass of
soil. These succeeded very well when transplanted,
but we should consider that plants from a drier poorer
soil, with roots equally fibrous, would be preferable,
could they be extracted with as much adhering earth,
which, however, could not be accomplished without
preparation and considerable labour. Were it the only
consideration to procure plants
which would best <span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span>
support the transplanting when of considerable size,
this, or the practice of cutting the roots, and encouraging
the rooting by manuring and thickening
the earth around the stool, would merit attention;
but as we have already stated, we consider plants
with these matted roots not so likely to grow to
large timber as those with several unchecked large
diverging root-leaders.</p>

<p>Besides the above mentioned part of orchard, we
have, by this practice, removed successfully (in some
cases so much so as that no trace of the removal appeared),
a considerable number of trees, where they
were growing too close, and think it simpler, and much
superior to Sir Henry’s, wherever the stool of the tree
can be turned up with a large cake of earth, as in cases
where the greater part of the roots run out horizontally
near the surface, which always occurs in flat ground,
when the subsoil is soaking with moisture the greater
part of the season. Whatever risk there may be
of the tree not growing when it has been subjected
to all Sir Henry’s formal and tedious process, assisted
by costly machinery, there is none here, provided
it is placed in drained trenched ground, as a considerable
number of the small fibres on which the
suction of moisture for supply of the leaves depends,
remain untouched, with this earth
around them, and <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
strike out immediately in the new moist soft soil;
and there is no laceration of the main roots, which,
by Sir Henry’s plan, cannot altogether be avoided,
this laceration being much more pernicious, and
likely to occasion putrescency, than simple cross section<a class="afnanc" href="#fn49" id="fnm49">49</a>.</p>

<p>By the above sledging practice, we have successfully
removed fruit trees
<span class="nowrap">2 <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>
feet in circumference, at
two feet from the ground, and have had some 20
feet high, make a new addition to their height of six
inches the first summer, where no shortening of the
top had taken place. We have also plucked fair
loads of fruit, both first and second
season, as large <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
and well matured as any of the same kind produced
by trees which had not been touched; but it is generally
prudent not to allow them to fruit the first
two seasons. As an experiment, we cut most of the
branches from the top of two of the trees—that is,
headed them down, but found these did not grow so
well as those which were only slightly pruned, or
not pruned at all.</p>

<p>Pruning at planting should take place in cases
where there are long annual shoots of the preceding
season, or much close spray as in old fruiting-trees;
the former should be cut
in, to
five or six buds in
length, and the latter ought to be thinned, to an extent,
which the kind of tree, the largeness and safe
state of the root, soil, exposure, and climate, must
determine: we request our readers to pay attention
to this. Pruning the long annual shoots, prevents a
too early formation of leaves, which often occurs in
moist cold soil, and which wither before the roots
begin to strike.</p>

<p>In some cases, where we found the earth too friable,
and not sufficiently bound together by the
roots, to rise up in a cake, we first prepared the stool
for upsetting, and waited for hard frost<a class="afnanc" href="#fn50" id="fnm50">50</a> to bind <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
the earth and roots into a firm body like a large
millstone, pouring some water upon it the evening
previous to the commencement of the frost, that it
might become firmer; we then proceeded with our
sledging during the frost if the road was smooth;
and, if rough, we covered over the frozen root with
straw to retain the frost; and the first day of fresh,
when the ground was soft and slippery above, and
hard underneath, we proceeded with our work, taking
care not to cover up the root with earth till it had
thawed. We have found (contrary to general opinion),
that no injury is sustained by exposure of the
roots of various kinds of trees to frost, or as great
cold as generally occurs at the surface of the ground
in this climate. We have succeeded equally well with
pear-trees, which had lain out on the exposed bare
crown of a ridge for two months of winter, without
the smallest quantity of earth adhering to the roots,
or protection of any kind, as with those immediately
from the ground where they grew. We have even
thought that a certain exposure of the roots to cold
increased their susceptibility to be stimulated to
strike quicker by the warmth of the ground in
spring, and thus the root suction coming to act
sooner than it usually does in transplanted trees
without balls, and nearer the time
of the expansion <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
of the leaves; the check occasioned by the upper
vegetation being too forward for the lower, was not
so great. In some cases a slight degree of withering
also appeared to have a good effect in deterring
the development of the buds till the earth acquired
a warmth sufficient for the root striking.</p>

<p>We succeeded to our wish with those we transplanted
by sledging, excepting a few which were placed
among young trees obtained from a sale nursery.
These young plants brought along with them a
number of the eggs of the common green caterpillar.
These eggs produced larvæ upon the young trees the
following spring; and these larvæ going down into the
earth, produced a small grey silvery moth in July.
The moths, from the tallest plants being most opposed
to them in their flight, or from being guided
by common parasitical instinct to choose the largest
subjects, deposited their eggs upon the removed old
trees in preference to those on which they had been
brought from the nursery,—a preference which did
not seem to arise from any sickliness of the old, as
they were fully as vigorous the first summer after
transplanting as the young. These imported vermin
prospering under the propitious dry warm summer
of 1826, rendered several of the old trees as
bare of foliage the second and third
June after <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span>
removal as they were in December; they have now,
however, recovered their vigour, shaken off their
parasites, and have produced good loads of fruit.</p>

<p>We may be thought fastidious in our tastes, and
extravagant in our wishes, but we desire and expect
more of our country gentlemen than to be mere
idlers, or worse than idlers,—practisers of the <i>Allanton
system</i>. When they turn their attention to forestry,
we would have them to sow, or to plant from
the nursery, and not to disturb and torture the fine
growing timber which their fathers had located, and
which generally suffers irreparable injury from removal,—a
system to which Sir Henry Steuart is so
absurdly attached, as to recommend its practice, although
only <i>to turn the lee side of the tree round</i>
to the wind in the same spot. Nor have we much
sympathy with Sir Walter Scott’s taste for home-keeping
squires,—those Shallows and Slenders with
whom our great dramatist has made himself so merry.
We would have our landed gentlemen to know
that <i>they</i> are the countrymen,—many of them, perhaps,
of the blood of the Raleighs, the Drakes, and
the Ansons. Let them, like our Wellington, our
Nelson, our Cochrane, Wilson, Miller, and many
others, continue to set before the world some little
assurance of British manhood. Let
them, like our <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
no less honourable Penns, and Baltimore, and Selkirk,
lay foundations of future empires. We would
have our young men of fortune go abroad into
the world as soon as their scholastic education is
completed,—not to spend a few idle years in Paris,
Rome, or other of the common enervating haunts,—they
might as well remain in mother’s drawingroom
or father’s stable; but to view man and nature
under every appearance. Let them acquire horsemanship
on the Pampas of La Plata; hunt the lion
and the elephant, and other game, at the Cape, and
study the botany and natural history of these prolific
wilds. Let their ideas shoot while they recline
under the lone magnificence of the primeval forest,
while they gallop over the unappropriated desert,
free as the Bedouin, or lie down composedly to sleep,
serenaded by the hyena and jackal’s howl, and
lion’s roar. Let them learn geology and mineralogy
on the Andes and Himalaya, and around every shore
where the strata are denuded. Let them wind about
among those abrupt rocks and craggy precipices,
where they may contemplate the sea-bird’s household
economy—the wild herbs of the cliff—the vegetation
and shells and monsters of the ocean—the
solitary white sail from distant land—the vestiges
of olden time, the exuviæ of former
worlds, in the <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
exposed strata—the abrasion of the rocky land by
the continued battering of the numberless pebbles
moved backward and forward by the heaving of the
ceaseless wave. Let them study the currents, and
winds, and meteorology on the ocean, and enjoy the
sublime feeling of riding over it in its wildest mood.
Let them join the ranks of freedom in any quarter
of the world where freedom is opposed to tyranny.
Let them head the savage horde, and introduce the
morality and arts of Britain among the ignorant
barbarian; or lead out colonies of our starved operatives
to new lands of high agricultural capability,
where for centuries no population-preventive checks
would be necessary. No other employment of life
could be so abounding in heart-stirring emotion, as
leading out the enthusiastic emigrants, with their
huddled groups of children, whom you know you
have rescued from the irksome unhealthy toil and
wretchedness of the city manufactory; no occupation
could be more delightful than cherishing the
new-born settlement during the privations and hardships
of infancy; in procuring a supply of food,
when through mistakes, owing to ignorance of the
climate and other circumstances, success had not attended
their industry; and in leading them on to an
effective self government. One
would gladly leave <span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span>
this old world, whose surface is disfigured all over
by man’s patched drilled deformities, and pass on to
a new one, where inviolated nature has produced
and reared her own children after her own fashion,
where every plant occupies its own place and blossoms
in its own time. This order must afford intense
delight to the naturalist, independent of the
novelty of every thing, from the constellation in the
sky to the lichen on the stone. In such a place,
one should feel remorse to suffer the hatchet to work,
or the ploughshare to enter in.</p>

<p>We fear these amusements (to which indeed, the
British seem more disposed than any other people),
would spoil all relish for the <i>Allanton system</i>, and
that our travellers, on their return, would suffer the
thriving trees planted by their fathers to remain at
rest, and rather incline to introduce into the park
some of their hardy foreign favourites—the iron-wood
evergreens of Patagonia, the valuable pines and other
trees of New Zealand and Eastern Asia. We believe,
also, that an acquaintance with the real world,
obtained in this way, would be much better fitted,
than the following Sir Walter’s recommendation, to
render our gentlemen in after life able and ready to
direct at the nation’s councils, and to improve their
estates, and the condition of
their dependents. <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>
Perhaps they would then disdain to hang on at St Stephen’s,
the contemptible retainers (all but in livery)
of some intriguing member of the cabinet, like
hungry jackals (call-jack), for the pickings their
master might leave them.</p>

<p class="padtopa">Having now looked at the general bearing of our
subject, we shall approach it a little closer, to examine
the facts, inductions, and minutiæ of the
practice.</p>

<p>When we first heard of Sir Henry Steuart’s celebrated
discoveries and new system of moving about
large live trees, and read Sir Walter Scott’s declaration,
that Birnam wood might now in reality come
down living to Dunsinane, we were disposed to hold
Sir Henry a magician, and were not a little alarmed
lest grown up trees might indeed acquire, under his
art, the locomotive power, and gallop about, to the
no small terror and danger of his Majesty’s subjects;
but, on closer examination, we find all Sir Henry’s
art resolve itself into transferring them from one
hole into another, by the labour of real men and
horses, without injuring the trees to such a degree
as preclude hope of recovery under proper subsequent
attention. His mode of performing this may
be stated shortly as follows:—</p>

<p>1st, Procure sturdy subjects, not
drawn up tall <span class="xxpn" id="p250">{250}</span>
and delicate in close plantations, but with short stem
balanced all round with numerous compact branches,
and well and regularly rooted, such as occur in open
situation on level surface. If you have not trees
possessing these <i>prerequisites</i> ready at hand Go
prepare them. Thin out your young woods to double
and triple distance, according as you intend to transfer
them to sheltered or exposed situations; cut the
roots of these trees, and trench around them at a
few feet distant from the bulb, or lay down rich compost
mould around them, to encourage exuberance
of rooting, <i>and in eight or ten years</i> you will have
fit subjects for removal!</p>

<p>2d, Prepare the site a year previous, by trenching
and manuring with compost, carefully mixing and
blending the whole (the upper and lower earth of
the soil and compost), and adding mould when the
soil is shallow; attending to thicken and mix clay
soil with sandy mould, and sand soil with clayey
mould, also guarding against lodgment of water.
Recent farm-yard dung, peat-moss, and quick-lime,
when well compounded together, make an excellent
compost manure.</p>

<p>3d, Commence extricating your trees by opening
a deep trench at the extremities of the roots, undermining
a little inward, and
gradually severing the <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
earth from the rootlets, by stirring, scraping, and shaking
with a very light pick, at the same time throwing
the separated earth out of the hole, and working
inward with the shovel underneath the bared
rootlets, till the tree is so far loosened as to be upset
by pulling on a rope fixed near the top, the rootlets,
as extricated, being bundled up so as to be as
much out of the way of injury as possible. Now,
throw some earth into the hole; re-elevate the tree
upon this earth, and upset it in the contrary direction;
continue to throw in earth, elevate and upset
in the contrary direction, till the bottom of the root
be nearly on a level with the surface of the ground.
Procure a large two wheeled wood-drag, and wheel
it backward close to the standing tree. Elevate
the pole of this drag, and tie it firmly aloft to the
stoutest and most convenient part of the top. Make
the body of the tree near the root fast to the axle,
or to a beam raised a little above the axle, a pad
intervening between the axle or beam and body of
the tree, to prevent injury to the bark; then by
pulling down upon the top of the pole, upset the
tree upon the drag, balancing as near as possible
upon the axle. All being now in readiness, attach
your horses to the reverse end of the drag, where
the root is swung, and have your
plant pulled <span class="xxpn" id="p252">{252}</span>
backward to its new berth, and deposit it carefully there,
without any top-pruning, having its heaviest branches
towards the west, that it may the better withstand
our prevailing winds, taking great care to divide
and comb out all the rootlets, and to pack in the
fine prepared mould, so as to separate them nearly
in the order they formerly occupied. Then <i>sad</i> down
the whole by beating or watering, and mulch over
all to exclude the drought.</p>

<p>4th, Water every two or three days in dry weather,
during the early part of the first summer, and
continue for several years to work over the surface of
the ground by repeated hoeing or otherwise, till the
tree has forgotten her rough treatment, and has become
reconciled to her new quarters.</p>

<p>Now, this is Sir Henry’s practice. What is there
here meriting the name of discovery? All the
world knew long ago, that trees drawn up tall and delicate,
in sheltered situations, were unfit for an open
exposure, especially when of considerable size. We
have ourselves dug trenches round trees, and picked
the earth from the rootlets with pointed instruments,
preserving as far as possible every fibre entire. We
have often collected fine mould and composts upon
the ground previous to planting, and trenched
over the soil; we have carefully
arranged the <span class="xxpn" id="p253">{253}</span>
rootlets, and packed in our prepared mould; we have
noticed that mutilating the top of certain kinds of
trees was very pernicious, particularly of the beech
and the oak; we have invariably turned round the
heaviest branches to the west; we have mulched
and watered the first summer, and have hoed around
the plants for years afterwards; conveyance by a
two-wheeled timber-drag has been long in use (we
have employed the axle and wheels of a common
cart); many, before Sir Henry, have prepared the
roots by previous cutting; what planter of experience
is ignorant of all this? We grant Sir Henry
has done all this well; much of it must have occurred
to himself, as it has done to us, as it will do
to any person of ordinary acuteness and observation,
but does this merit the name of discovery, or comparison
with steam and gas?</p>

<p>We shall now give some little attention to a subject
on which we consider Sir Henry’s claim to the
rank of philosophic discoverer solely rests, and which
he introduces to our notice certainly with sufficient
prefatory flourish, under the designation of his “new
principle,” “his rational theory,” which he predicts
will raise transplanting of trees of considerable size
to the rank of a useful art, it being thus founded on
fixed principles. In order to bring
the matter fairly <span class="xxpn" id="p254">{254}</span>
before the mind of our readers, we are under the necessity
of having recourse to a long quotation. We
fear our readers will find Sir Henry’s metaphysics
not very intelligible; but this may well be forgiven,
we are all too guilty of plunging about when we get
into deep water, and some of us have not always sense
enough to swim with the stream.</p>

<p>We here introduce a quotation of our author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“But while every organic creation tends to full development,
that is, to absolute energy, or perfect life,
still we find, that the organs of which it is composed
are each reciprocally dependent on every other,
for the possibility and degree of their peculiar action.
At the same time, as these internal conditions of animated
existence are severally dependent on certain
external conditions, which, again, are not always fully
and equally supplied; so it follows, that the life of
every organized being is determined in its amount,
and in the direction of its development, by the outward
circumstances of its individual situation. For
this reason, we see that every animal, and every plant,
is dependent for its existence, and also for its perfect
existence, on conditions both internal and external.</p>

<p>“From this reasoning it may be conceived, how
the several parts of the living whole reciprocally act
and react. They are, in fact, cause
and effect <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
mutually; and no one can precede another, either in
the order of nature, or of time. Thus, in an animal,
the digestive, and the absorbent, the sanguineous,
the respiratory, and the nervous systems are at
once relative and correlative. In like manner, in a
plant, the same reciprocal proportion is found to hold
between the roots and the stem, the branches and
the leaves: Each modifies and determines the existence
of all the others, and is equally affected by
all in its turn. And as their several parts, by
means of their union, constitute the organic whole;
and as their functions, by the same means, realize
the complement of life, which the plant or animal
exhibits; it is evident, that every living individual
is a necessary system, in which no one part can be
affected, without affecting the other parts, and
throughout which there reigns an intimate sympathy,
and a complete harmony of perfection and imperfection.</p>

<p>“Further; The external conditions of this internal
development of plants and animals, are Food,
Air, and Heat; while Light seems to be a peculiar
condition, indispensably necessary to plants. Where
any one of these conditions is not supplied, the existence
of life, whether animal or vegetable, becomes
impossible; where it is insufficiently
supplied, life is <span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
proportionally enfeebled or repressed. But, to limit
our consideration to the vegetable kingdom, it may
be observed, that where a loose and deep soil affords
an abundant supply of food, where a genial climate
diffuses warmth in an adequate degree, and where a
favourable exposure allows a competent access of
light (for air, being fully and universally given, may
be thrown out of the case); in these circumstances,
a plant, if not mechanically injured, will vigorously
exercise its functions, and attain the full development
of its parts, thus realizing the absolute complement
of life, to which it naturally tends. In the
same way, when these conditions are stinted, the
luxuriance of the plant is checked, in the ratio of
that restraint, and the deficiency of the supply.
Where any one of the external conditions is partially
or inadequately supplied, the plant appears to make
special, and even forced efforts to secure as much of
the beneficial influence as it can, and to accommodate
itself to the exigency of its situation. Thus, where
light is admitted only from a single point, a plant
concentrates all its powers, in stretching towards the
direction of the light. Where light is shed all around,
the plant throws out its branches on every
side. In conformity with this principle, we find,
that, in the interior of a wood, where
the Trees <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span>
mutually impede the lateral admission of light, the tendency
of each is upwards; and the consequence of
this tendency is, that the plant is thereby not developed
in its natural and perfect proportions, but is
elongated, or drawn up to an undue height. It displays
its ramification chiefly near the top; while the
imperfection of its life is manifested in the whole
character of its vegetation. In open exposures, on
the other hand, the tree developes its existence, in
full health and luxuriance. It reaches a height, such
as the soil and situation admit, and sufficient to allow
the branches, which are thrown out on every
side, to expand their leaves freely to the sun. Not
being compelled to concentrate its efforts, in securing
a scanty supply of one beneficial influence, all its
proportions are absolute and universal, not relative
and particular. In such circumstances, therefore, it
may be considered as in a full and natural state of
perfection.</p>

<p>“Another condition of vegetable life appears to
be an adequate degree of Heat. Within a certain
range of temperature, vegetation is positively promoted:
Below, or above a certain point (the degree
differing in different species of plants), vegetation
is positively checked. To speak only of the
latter case, which is briefly expressed
by the term <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span>
Cold, it is either produced by absolute lowness of
temperature, or, in particular circumstances, by the
generation of cold, through the effect of wind, and
consequent evaporation from a moist surface; for
trees, in themselves, have but little self-generated
heat, above the surrounding temperature. Some
they certainly possess, otherwise they would be killed
during severe frosts. Of the above accidents nature
can modify the former, by accommodating different
species of plants to different latitudes and elevations:
Against the latter she adopts the plan of affording
suitable protection to the individual. In
the interior of woods, where the free current of air
is intercepted, where stillness and serenity are maintained,
and where each tree affords shelter, more or
less, to every other, nature has little need to generate
the provisions necessary to mitigate the injurious
effects of evaporation. But, in open exposures,
and in the case of isolated trees, this effect must
be assuaged, and is, in fact, to a certain extent alleviated,
by various provisions or properties, bestowed
upon the tree itself. In the first place, a thicker
and closer ramification of the sides and top is supplied,
and a more abundant spray towards the stormy
quarter, thereby furnishing a kind of clothing of
leaves, in order to protect from cold
both the <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span>
ascending and the descending sap-vessels: And, secondly,
a greater induration of the epidermis, and thickness
of the cortical layers of the bark are provided;
which, forming a bad conductor of heat, act as a still
more effectual defence to the stem, by preventing
the immediate and powerful application of cold,
through the sudden subtraction of caloric, from the
proper vessels of the inner bark.</p>

<p>“In this economy, nature only follows the analogy
which she displays in modifying the influence
of cold upon the animal kingdom. The quadrupeds,
which are destined to encounter the severity of an
Arctic winter, are provided with thick and shaggy
coats, to enable them to withstand the intensity of
the cold; and all the richest furs, which man employs
to supply his natural, or rather his artificial
wants, are always furnished by animals inhabiting
the highest latitudes, and killed during the severest
frosts. What is still more illustrative of the point
under consideration is, that the coats of animals, of
which the thin and short hair is familiar to us in the
temperate climates, such as the dog, the fox, and
the ox, are all remarkable, under the polar regions,
for their close, lengthened, and almost impenetrable
fibre, as a secure barrier of non-conducting matter,
to prevent the escape of
their vital heat. <span class="xxpn" id="p260">{260}</span></p>

<p>“In like manner, in all the other relations, we
see Nature especially accommodating the character
of each individual plant, to the exigencies of its particular
situation. In the interior of woods, the
wind can exert a far less mechanical effect on individual
trees; and therefore, while they are <i>positively</i>
determined to push upwards towards the light, they
are <i>negatively</i> permitted to do so, by the removal of
any necessity to thicken their trunks, for the sake
of greater strength, and to contract the height of
them, in order to afford the blast a shorter lever
against the roots. But, with trees in an open situation,
all this is widely different. There they are
freely exposed to the wind, and the large expansion
of their branches, gives every advantage to the violence
of the storm. Nature, accordingly, bestows
greater proportional thickness, and less proportional
elevation on trees, which are isolated, or nearly so;
while their system of root, which, by necessity, is
correlatively proportional to their system of top, affords
likewise heavier ballast, and a stronger anchorage,
in order to counteract the greater spread of sail,
displayed in the wider expansion of the branches.</p>

<p>“Every individual tree is thus a beautiful system
of qualities, specially relative to the place which it
holds in creation; of
provisions admirably <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span>
accommodated to the peculiar circumstances of its case. Here
every thing is necessary; nothing is redundant. In
the words of a great philosopher, who was an accurate
observer of nature, ‘Where the necessity is
obviated, the remedy, by consequence, is withdrawn.’
If these facts and reasonings be correctly stated, the
only rational theory of the removal of large trees
consists, in prospectively maintaining the same harmony
between the existing provisions of the tree,
and the exigencies of its new situation, as had previously
subsisted between its relative properties and
the circumstances of its former site.”</p>

<p>“In considering the characteristics of trees above
mentioned, we should always bear in mind, that
every production of nature is an end to itself, and
that every part of it is, at once, end and mean. Of
trees in open exposures we find, that their peculiar
properties contribute, in a remarkable manner, to
their health and prosperity. In the first place, their
shortness and greater girth of stem, in contradistinction
to others in the interior of woods, are obviously
intended to give to the former greater strength to
resist the winds, and a shorter lever to act upon the
roots; Secondly, their larger heads, with spreading
branches, in consequence of the free access of light,
are formed as plainly for the nourishment,
as well as <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span>
the balancing of so large a trunk, and also for furnishing
a cover to shield it from the elements;
Thirdly, their superior thickness and induration of
bark is, in like manner, bestowed for the protection
of the sap-vessels that lie immediately under it, and
which, without such defence from cold, could not
perform their functions; Fourthly, their greater
number and variety of roots are for the double purpose
of nourishment and strength; nourishment to
support a mass of such magnitude, and strength to
contend with the fury of the blast.”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, in the interior of woods, a
universal tendency, for the reasons already stated, is
observable in trees, to rise to the light, to attain
greater altitude, to form far smaller heads, and taller,
slenderer, and more elegant stems. Here is
found a milder and more genial climate; in which,
by means of the calm generated by shelter, vegetation
is not checked by cold, and, at the same time,
is undisturbed by the external impediment of wind;
and nature has no need, as in the case of exposures,
to generate provisions necessary to mitigate the effect
of evaporation, as has been above observed, or
to endue each individual tree with distinct and appropriate
means of defence against the elements.”</p>

<p>“That, as the four
protecting properties, <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
already delineated, as belonging to trees in open situations,
are essential and necessary to the vigorous
development of their existence, so they may be set
down as indispensable prerequisites for those intended
for transplantation, which generally implies
increased exposure; and that soil and climate being
equal, such subjects will succeed the best as are endued
in the greatest degree with those prerequisites
or properties.”</p>

<p>“If we adopt this principle, and follow it up
with a judicious mode of execution, it seems evident
that the necessity of defacing or mutilating
the fine tops of trees will be entirely superseded. <i>We
shall obtain at once</i>, what the art, as hitherto practised,
has not been able to obtain for us, the Immediate
and Full effect of Wood, that is, <i>Trees complete
and perfect in all their parts</i>, without the
loss of the time required to replace the parts so defaced
and mutilated.”—“And if such a mode of
execution be superinduced upon it, as shall furnish
to the tree a competent supply of sap at the critical
period of removal, the art probably may be said to
be established on <i>fixed principles</i>.”</p>

<p>“Wind being, in a great degree, excluded in unthinned
plantation, and evaporation prevented, heat
is, by consequence, generated in
an undue degree. <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
In the same way, light is nearly shut out from such
plantations, except from the top, and a disproportionate
elongation of the stem is occasioned <i>by the
efforts which each individual makes to gain the
light</i>.” P. 191.</p></blockquote>

<p class="padtopb">Now,
what do we gather from all these <i>discoveries</i>
which, in continuation, our author turns round
and round, and exhibits to us under every combination,
with admirable elegance, it must be allowed,
like the objects in a kaleidoscope?—that trees
grown in sheltered situation are not suited for exposed
situation, because their roots are proportionally
too small, and the stem too long for stability under
the strain of high winds; their exterior bark or epidermis,
dead and living, too thin to afford protection
to the sap-vessels from cold, the effect of evaporation
caused by the wind; their spray and leaves too elevated
and open to exclude the cold, or wind generating
cold, from the stem and branches. That the
reverse coexistent conditions of trees in open situation—short
stout stem, thick bark dead and living,
strong rooting, close cover of spray and leaves
all around, befitting the plant to withstand the tempest,
and affording shelter to the sap-vessels of the
stem and branches—and these
conditions being <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
wanting when redundant in sheltered situation, show the
beautiful adaptation of means to end, like warm fur of
animals in cold countries: That trees being formed
to grow tall in close situation, is a beneficent provision
of Providence for accommodating man with
straight long clean deal and beams: That trees shoot
tall in close situation because they strain hard to
reach the light: That trees shoot tall in close situation
from warmth: That shelter and exposure is heat
and cold: That, “to establish any just analogy between
the transplanting of young and of old trees is
utterly impossible:” That these conditions of trees
being thus explained to mankind, and followed up
by judicious execution, the thing is reduced to fixed
principles, and raised to the rank of an useful art,
and the necessity of defacing, or mutilating, the fine
tops of trees, when transplanted, entirely superseded.</p>

<p>We shall now attempt to weigh some of these
assertions and conclusions of Sir Henry, and to
pursue these inquiries a little farther.</p>

<p>It is known to every forester, that trees growing
in close order, and drawn up tall, will not continue
healthy on being thinned out to very open arrangement,
but will often fall victims to the change of
circumstances, even though they withstand the gale.
Who, then, would be guilty of the
folly of expecting <span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
they would bear exposure and the injuries of transplanting
at the same time? Sir Henry Steuart
mentions some particular facts as causes of this unsuitableness.
Perhaps it would have been as well
to ascribe it to general inaptitude and delicacy, as
there are several other circumstances not easily understood,
such as vital stamina, habitude or acclimatizing,
and texture and configuration of vessels,
which must have influence. We should also think
simple evaporation of the fluids of the transplanted
tree a much greater cause of its failure than the cold
of this or of any other evaporation acting to numb
the sap-vessels in the stem and branches. The absorbing
mouths of the rootlets, excepting in the case
of very large balls, are generally destroyed by the
operation of removal; and the development of the
leaves to a certain extent taking place before any
new process of striking of the roots, owing to the
atmosphere and branches getting sooner heated in
spring than the ground and roots, the half-developed
leaves shrivel up in the arid spring air, from
the evaporation of the juices and deficiency of root-suction;
and when the air gets moist, showers fall,
and the earth becomes warm enough for the <i>striking</i>
of the roots, the vital principle is too far spent,
or the material substance too much
changed, for the <span class="xxpn" id="p267">{267}</span>
recommencement of organic action. We have found
that trees which had remained months out of ground,
and were planted in March, succeed better than
trees removed immediately from their old site to
their new, both being planted with equal care in
the same ground at the same time. The latter acquired
half developed leaves early in April, which
withered from deficiency of root-suction; and it was
only with attention that we succeeded in causing
them to bud forth anew and acquire leaves about
midsummer; in several, we stimulated the root-suction
by application of heated water, covering up
with litter to retain the heat. The former were several
weeks more backward in leafing, and when the
buds burst, the ground had become warm enough
for <i>root-striking</i>, and the vegetation proceeded without
check. Sir Henry will say, that the check sustained
by those which leafed early, was owing to
the numbing effect of the cold spring wind, and of
the cold of evaporation on the sap-vessels of the
stem; but we had caused several of them to be
wrapped round the stem with soft straw-ropes, and
this did not prevent the shrivelling of the leaves, although
it certainly protected the sap-vessels from
the cold. This withering of the leaves of transplanted
trees, by which large
transplanted trees so <span class="xxpn" id="p268">{268}</span>
frequently perish, is most prevalent in cold damp
soils, when the air is dry and the sun powerful, and
evidently results from the superior vegetation being
in advance of the inferior; torpor of the roots, not
torpor of the sap-vessels of the stem from cold. It
is also perfectly evident, that trees with long naked
stems will suffer most, as their leaves are raised
higher, more in the current of the drying wind;
their root and top farther asunder, therefore less
liable to contemporaneous impulse; the sap-vessels
of the stem longer and more attenuated, therefore
the streams of fluids from the soil, not only smaller,
but also more liable to obstruction, or to flow slowly,
from the insufficiency of the vital impulse, or of endosmose
in the wounded sickly plant to impel to such
a height. Our author’s assertion, that the rough epidermis
generally covering the live bark of trees in
open situations, is necessary to the health of the tree,
in protecting the sap-vessels from cold, is, we think,
not quite correct. Some time ago we caused the dead
epidermis be hewn down from several trees, in a rather
exposed situation. This was done with considerable
nicety, and extending up along the branches.
We remember of one case, of very thick indurated
epidermis, where a carpenter was employed more
than a day in laying bare the live bark
of one tree. <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span>
Instead of suffering injury by this exposure of the
sap-vessels to cold, the trees rather acquired new vigour
from the operation; and the particular tree
alluded to, was unusually luxuriant the season following
this flaying, which was performed in winter.
Now, to apply Sir Henry’s analogy of fur of animals,
would an arctic fox have been benefited by
exposure to the winter’s cold in like plight? We
also think Sir Henry will find the trees of dry climates
have a much thicker coating of dead bark than
in cold countries, evidently a consequence of desiccation<a class="afnanc" href="#fn51" id="fnm51">51</a>,
and, if Sir Henry must have animal analogy—similar
to the desiccation and cracking of the skin of
man in arid air. <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span></p>

<p>It is a subject of considerable difficulty to explain
the cause of slender lengthened shoots in sheltered
situations, and short stout shoots in exposed. Sir
Henry solves this “excellently well” in two ways,
first, attributing it to shelter and exposure themselves,—“for
shelter is heat, and exposure cold,”—and
again, to an instinctive straining in the sheltered
to reach the light, of which its neighbours deprive
it every way but from above, and would do so there
too if it failed to exert itself.</p>

<p>We find that vegetables have long spindling
shoots, and wide spaces between the leaves or buds,
when growing in a damp, still, close atmosphere, especially
when the plant is sickly or weak from deficiency
of nourishment, and that this happens equally,
whether a trailing plant being supported aloft throws
out depending shoots in opposition to the current
of light; whether a climbing<a class="afnanc" href="#fn52" id="fnm52">52</a> plant runs out horizontally
along a branch or beam at right angles to
the light, or whether a self-supported mounting
plant rises in direct opposition to gravity. No
doubt, when the light comes from one direction, <span class="xxpn" id="p271">{271}</span>
such as the aperture of a window, the plant shoots
forth towards the light, possibly in consequence
of the leaves inclining themselves to receive the ray
on their superficies, and thus leading the shoot in the
direction of the light. But this does not prove any
straining or lengthening of the shoot to approach the
light; and we ask, what do general opinion and Sir
Henry found their belief upon, of lengthening
growth and straining to approach the light?</p>

<p>Again, with regard to heat, we notice that plants,
particularly shoots from tubers, left to sprout in
cold, damp, confined cellars, throw out very long
stems, with wide spaces between the buds or leaves,
and that very long shoots always occur in confined
damp air—long in the ratio of the dampness and
confinement, whatever the degree of heat may be,
provided it exceed a little the vegetating point. Also
on the north side of hills, the trees have generally
longer stems than on the sun-ward side, although in
the former case, they are exposed to the northern
blast, while in the latter they bask in the sun. Has
the same kind of plant, in lower latitudes, longer
spaces between the leaves than in higher? And if
it has not, is the cold, from greater evaporation,
sufficient to balance the superior heat
of the climate? <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span></p>

<p>The above facts must lead, we think, to the conclusion,
that evaporation, or non-evaporation, of the
fluids, has, directly, a very considerable influence in
causing a shorter or longer extension of the shoot
between the buds or leaves, and that the influence
of the cold of this evaporation is at most but of a
very secondary character. We would compare the
extending rudiments and matter of the young scion
to the slow flowing of a gelatinous fluid. In moist
air, the watery part is slowly evaporated, and the
drop extends into a long pendulous form. In dry
air, the water of solution is quickly evaporated, longitudinal
extension ceases, and the pendant is thicker
and shorter. The cold of evaporation may a
little affect the fluidity, but only in a very small degree<a class="afnanc" href="#fn53" id="fnm53">53</a>.</p>

<p>The causes of the elongation of vegetables are, <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
however, not very plain. We have noticed, that the
deeper the seed is placed in the ground, the braird
rises the higher above ground, even when the seeds
at the different depths have been equally moist. This
might admit of explanation, but having already occupied
too much space with this subject, we shall
only remark further, that in close woods, the trees
elongate, because they are precluded from extending
laterally. The top buds, from receiving more
of the stimulating or nourishing influence of the
dew, sun’s rays, fresh unvitiated air, invigorating
motion of the winds, and perhaps of electricity<a class="afnanc" href="#fn54" id="fnm54">54</a>, <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span>
throw out a greater continuation of shoot than the
under branches; nearly the whole nourishment from
the soil being on this account drawn up and consumed
by these top shoots, and the lower overshadowed
twigs and branches languishing and dying
from the absence of these advantages. Besides this
extension of top shoots, by the greater continuation
of leaves, or links of life, occasioned by the above
causes, these shoots, owing to the moist atmosphere
of the wood, also push out into longer spaces between
the leaves. However, these top branches do
not push sun-ward, but merely in opposition to gravity.</p>

<p>Sir Henry states, that “trees certainly possess
some heat, otherwise they would be killed during
severe frosts.” Our belief of the vital heat of vegetables
is placed on a much better foundation than <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
this <i>otherwise</i>; otherwise our credence would be far
from philosophic. Freezing cold affects many vegetables
as well as some of the lower animals, only by
mechanical injury, in rending the vessels by means
of the expansion of the contained fluid. Now, if
these vessels are not quite full of fluid, if the fluid
be of such a nature as not to congeal into greater
size, or if the body be small, and the vessels elastic,
to yield to expansion without fracture—the vegetable
or animal will often resume vitality, on being
thawed from thorough congelation. We have rendered
potatoes, turnips, and fruits, frost-proof, at
least unless the frost was intense, by a slight desiccation
caused by exposing them a short time to the
air after being taken from the ground or tree<a class="afnanc" href="#fn55" id="fnm55">55</a>. In
the cases where fishes and reptiles have been found <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
frozen so hard as to require a hatchet to dissect
them, and reviving on thawing, it will be found that
the fluids were principally oleaginous, which do not
expand in congealing; and in the case of insects being
frozen in masses during the night, and resuming
their liveliness next day in the sun, we think, if their
fluids have congealed at all, that either the vessels
must have yielded, being elastic (which might more
likely take place in a small body, without general
fracture and derangement), or that the fluids had not
extended by being congealed; but it is very probable,
though frozen together in a mass of water
and mud, that their fluids, from being of an acid
nature, had resisted the congelation.</p>

<p>With regard to trees, we have heard that intense
frost often splits the trunks of some of our indigenous
kinds by congelation<a class="afnanc" href="#fn56" id="fnm56">56</a>; but these trees retain
vitality, and only suffer from the consequences
which may ensue from the fissures. We have
seen evergreens, plants from milder climates, and
trees which had not thoroughly ripened their <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span>
wood (that is, retained the vessels full of moisture),
injured in the extremities, and even killed
throughout by cold. But this does not prove that
these had any vegetable heat, any more than those
which suffered no injury from the same degree of
cold, prove that they had vegetable heat. The juices
of some kinds of plants do not congeal at the same
point of temperature as others. The vessels of some
in winter are not so much distended with fluids as
others; and probably the vital principle of some is
less susceptible of injury from cold than others. These
facts may account for the endurance of intense cold
by some kinds of trees, independent of vegetable
heat.</p>

<p>Our author, speaking of the transplanting of
fruit trees, states, that “any gardener could have
predicted the probability of fruit during the first
season, together with the certainty during the second
of its not taking place.” Our gardeners will
be moonstruck at having the gift of prophecy attributed
to them, at least to predict in such a way.
We have thought Sir Henry sufficiently ready to
impute ignorance to gardeners before we came to this
remark; but to represent a useful and intelligent
class of men in so ludicrous a light, is certainly using
a very improper liberty. <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span></p>

<p>Every gardener is aware that trees will fruit the
first season after transplanting, just if they have had
the rudiments of the fruit formed in the bud before
transplanting, and should the blossom not be injured
by severe weather. Every gardener is aware, though
Sir Henry seems not, that all fruit trees, of any size,
form these rudiments the season after transplanting,
and that they invariably fruit the second season, if
the season suit the fruiting of the kind; and every
gardener of any experience is capable, even without
Sir Henry’s instructions, of removing a fruit tree of
considerable size, without injuring it so severely as
to prevent it fruiting both first and second season,
which it will do, and even mature fine fruit both
years, though during the first, under very unfavourable
circumstances, it should scarcely be able to develope
leaves 1-5th of the usual size, and though
these leaves wither and drop off long before the summer
is ended, while the fruit remains to ripen on the
tree. This is <i>a direct consequence of evaporation</i>.
The thin leaves shrivel up in the ardent sun from
evaporation and want of sufficient supply by root-suction;
and the bulbs of the fruit, from their massiveness,
contain sufficient moisture to resist withering
till the night, when they drink the dews, and suck
up some little moisture from
the roots, undiminished <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
by evaporation in the transit, to replenish the daily
loss.</p>

<p>Sir Henry remarks, that “no man who knows
any thing of wood, will put down the oak or the
elm on light sand or gravel, as it is only on deep
loam and clay that the oak, in particular, will really
thrive and grow into timber.” No man who knows
<i>how much a suitable soil for any kind of plant is
under regulation of the moistness or dryness of the
atmosphere, and other circumstances</i>, will refrain
from smiling at Sir Henry’s very superficial acquaintance
with his own subject, and at the manner he
thus again brings forward mankind to testify in support
of his own error. Our author will place the
above quotation among the errata should he take a
ride up Strath-Tay from Birnam to Kenmore.</p>

<p>Among other items of expense given by our author,
none of which seem to be overstated, we feel
grateful for the information, that compost manure of
lime, farm-yard dung, and moss, can be obtained,
compounded, fermented, conveyed and applied, at
the rate of 6d. and 9d. per single and double load!</p>

<p>Sir Henry makes good his assertion, that slow
grown timber is always stronger, denser, and more
durable than fast grown, by a cloud of witnesses,—every
forester, gardener, and carpenter
of the <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
country, is ready to attest it of course! There are few
sublunary matters which admit of evidence more
conclusive. We quote his account of this uniform
“law of nature.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The same general law operates in a similar
way on all woody plants, but of course less rapidly,
owing to the less rapid growth of trees, from the
lowest bush to the oak of the forest. In all these,
the culture of the soil tends to <i>accelerate vegetation</i>,
and by consequence to <i>expand the fibre of the wood</i>.
It necessarily renders it softer, less solid, and more
liable to suffer by the action of the elements. Let
us shortly give a few examples of the uniform effect
of this law of nature.</p>

<p>“Every forester is aware how greatly easier it is
to cut over thorns or furze that are trained in hedges,
than such as grow naturally wild, and are exempt
from culture. Gardeners experience the same thing
in pruning or cutting over fruit trees or shrubs;
and, the difference of the texture of the raspberry in
its wild and in its cultivated state, is as remarkable;
for although the stem in the latter state is nearly
double the thickness of that in the former, it is
much more easily cut. On comparing the common
crab, the father of our orchards,
with the cultivated <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span>
apple, the greater softness of the wood of the latter
will be found no less striking to every arboriculturist.</p>

<p>“Further, the common oak in Italy and Spain,
where it grows faster than in Britain, is ascertained
to be of shorter duration in those countries. In the
same way, the oak in the Highland districts of
Scotland or Wales, is of a much harder and closer
grain, and therefore more durable, than what is
found in England; though in such mountains it
seldom rises to the fifth part, or less, of the English
tree. Every carpenter in Scotland knows the extraordinary
difference between the durability of
Highland oak and oak usually imported from England,
for the spokes of wheels. Every extensive
timber-dealer is aware of the superior hardness of
oak raised in Cumberland and Yorkshire, over that
of Monmouthshire and Herefordshire; and such a
dealer in selecting trees in the <i>same</i> woods, in <i>any</i>
district, will always give the preference to oak of
slow growth, and found in cold and clayey soils, and
to ash on rocky cliffs, which he knows to be the soils
and climates natural to both. If he take a cubic
foot of park-oak, and another of forest-oak, and
weigh the one against the other (or if he
do the like <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
with ash and elm of the same description), the latter
will uniformly turn out the heavier of the two.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is certainly the case, that luxuriant growth
increases the size of the sap-vessels and cells, but
with this increase of size, there is often a proportional
increase of thickness of the sides of these vessels
and cells, and a greater than proportional filling
up of dense matter, as the alburnum is better ripened
in autumn, or as the mature wood, especially
of hard wood in dry situations, ripens more
slowly in the course of years. There is also in many
kinds more of close tissue and cellular part, in proportion
to large sap-vessels, when the tree is growing
vigorously than when it is stunted. (See the
facts in our notice of Withers, p. 199.) <i>Thence
culture does not necessarily render the timber softer,
less solid, and more liable to suffer by the action
of the elements.</i> We are really angry with
those smooth-tongued rogues who “fool us to the
top of our bent.” <i>Every artificer</i> who has worked
slow grown ash of considerable age, that is, when
most of the timber has been deposited after the tree
has been seeding strongly, <i>assures us</i> that the timber
is very inferior, in all respects, to that of quicker
growth. <span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span></p>

<p>We consider the forester who has observed that
thorns or furze trained in hedges are much easier cut
from softness of timber than when growing in detached
bushes, a much better observer than ourselves; and
we would inquire whether he were certain that the
greater efficiency of his blows was not owing to their
being better directed, from the conveniency of access,
owing to the training up, than from the timber
being softer? The example of the raspberry we
consider very irrelevant, it being only a semi-herbaceous
plant of biennial stem.</p>

<p>Gardeners certainly experience the branches and
roots of crab-apple to be harder than the varieties
with thicker bark, larger more downy leaves, and
larger fruit. The largest growing apple varieties,
however, are not the above mentioned mild varieties,
but those which have a pretty close approximation
to the crab. We have taken slips from some
of the very largest of our pear-trees, and having
placed them close to the ground on young stocks,
have found they threw out spines and rectangular
branching similar to crabs. Those most dissimilar
to the crab have thick annual shoots, without any lateral
rectangular branching, and very thick bark;
they have been gradually bred to this condition by
repeated sowing, always choosing the
seed of those <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
partaking most of these qualities for resowing, their
disposition to vary to mildness being at the same
time influenced in some measure by culture and
abundant moist nourishment; but these mild varieties,
although they throw out a strong annual
shoot while young, seldom or never reach to any
considerable size of tree, unless they are nourished
by crab roots, their own roots being soft and fleshy,
and incapable of foraging at much depth or distance.
Their branches and twigs as they get old, are also
very soft and friable, covered with a thick bark, but
the timber of the stem is very little inferior in hardness
to crab timber.</p>

<p>We ask, if even the fact of these unnaturally tender
varieties (obtained by long-continued selection,
probably assisted by culture, soil and climate, and
which, without the cherishing of man, would soon
disappear), being of rather more porous texture of
wood, goes any length to prove our author’s assertion?
We have paid some attention to the fibre of
the genus Pyrus, and find that the Siberian crabs
have by far the smallest vessels. Having grafted
the large Fulwood upon the smallest Red Siberian
Crab, or Cherry-apple, the new wood layers above
the junction swelled to triple the thickness of those
below. By ingrafting other
kinds upon other <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
stocks, we have found the reverse to take place, no
doubt owing to those with largest vessels swelling
the most, there being the same number of vessels
above and below the junction, each corresponding,
or being a continuation of the other<a class="afnanc" href="#fn57" id="fnm57">57</a>. But this
small Siberian crab, when ingrafted upon a common
crab, grew fully as quickly during several years as
the Fulwood under the same circumstances; and the
timber, though of much finer texture, scarcely exceeded
the other in hardness. Sir Henry tells us,
that the oak is less durable in Italy and Spain than
in England<a class="afnanc" href="#fn58" id="fnm58">58</a>. We tell Sir Henry, that the red-wood
pitch-pine from Georgia and the Floridas, on
the confines of the torrid zone, is more durable
than the red-wood pine from Archangel, on the
confines of the frigid zone. But
does this fact <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
regarding the oak of the south of Europe, prove any
thing regarding the oak of England,—that it will
always he deteriorated by culture for several years
after planting, or that the quality may not suffer
as much from slowness of growth as from fastness,
or from the climate being too cold as from being too
warm?</p>

<p>The reason why Highland Scots oak spokes are
superior to English, is, because the latter are generally
split from out the refuse of the timber cut for
naval purposes,—principally <i>the branches and tops</i>
of large trees; whereas, those from the Highlands of
Scotland are from <i>the root cuts</i> of copse. We believe
most carpenters of Scotland are aware of this.
The oak from the Highlands of Scotland is, however,
for the most part, of excellent quality, growing generally
on <i>dry gravel and rock</i>, not on cold moist
<i>clayey soils</i>. The hardest we have ever seen was
from a steep, dry gravel bank, of south exposure,
in an open situation, much exposed to the western
breeze. The Highland oak from these soils is generally
of a greyish colour, and very dense; whereas
that from moist soils is often reddish-brown, and
defective. Should Sir Henry weigh portions of oak
from these soils in a pair of material, in place of
mental scales, we think his
conclusions would be <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
somewhat different.—The strongest, hardest ash we
have seen, was cut from a hard, dry, adhesive clay,
of course a young tree.</p>

<p>Sir Henry, speaking of the Western Highlands and
Islands of Scotland, states that “it is from a want of
soil, and not of climate, that woods of any given extent
cannot be got up in these unsheltered, but romantic
situations.” Of many situations of these
bleak districts, this must be admitted, but we cannot
receive it as a general fact; and even where it
holds true, the want of (proper) soil, or formation of
peat, is a <i>consequence</i> of the want of climate, although
<i>this</i> may have reacted to increase the evil.
There must have been a greater warmth of climate,
at least in summer, when the forests grew, which
lie buried in the mosses of the northern part of
Scotland, and of the Orkney and Shetland Islands,
as some kinds of timber are found in situations where
such kinds, by no circumstances of gradual shelter
under the present climate, could have grown. There
are several indications of a greater warmth having
been general throughout Britain, and even farther
eastward, and that a slight refrigeration is still in
progress. We instance the once numerous vineyards
of England,—the vestiges of aration so numerous
upon many of our hills, where it would now be
considered fruitless to attempt
raising grain, even <span class="xxpn" id="p288">{288}</span>
with the assistance of modern science; and the report
that the Caspian is gradually overflowing her
shores, a probable consequence of diminished evaporation
from decrease of heat.</p>

<p>That this is not wholly owing to the moisture
and cold consequent to the moss formation, or to
any cover or want of cover to the earth, of timber, or
of any other plants which might possibly have effect
upon the temperature by shade, evolution of vegetable
heat, electric or meteoric agency, we think
proved, should the asserted fact be correct, that, in
the small <i>oes</i> of Shetland, (so distant from any considerable
portion of land as not to be under these
influences, and so small, that the climate must be
solely dependant upon the sea), timber is found in the
morasses, although the climate will not now admit
of timber growing, being apparently equally deteriorated
as that of the Mainland. It is not improbable
that the superior former climate of the North of
Scotland and Islands was owing to their having
formed, at one time, an extensive country, perhaps
joined to the continent, and thus partaking of the
continental climate, that is, having a colder winter
and warmer summer, capable of producing considerable
vigour of arboreous vegetation, and not so favourable
to the generating of that fixed vegetable
incubus, peat-moss, who has crept
over, and folded <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
in her chill embrace, the once fair districts of northern
Scotland. The fogs and more steady low temperature
of insular situation, which now prevail, not
only induce that chemical change in dead and dying
vegetables which forms peat-moss, and preserves
this moss from decay, but also being too cool for the
vegetation of the gramineæ, &amp;c. tend only to promote
the general spread of sphagni and other moss-generating
plants, which, again, are almost the only
plants that can vegetate on acrid moss-flow, as they
draw little or nothing from below, and are nourished
directly by the moisture and other fluids of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Our eastern shore affords sufficient proof that the
ocean has both receded and advanced recently—at
least recently in comparison with the great changes
which have occurred to modify the surface of the
earth. In proof of this recession, we have the upper
<i>carses</i>, or deltas, visible in every firth or creek
where a river falls into the German Sea. These
carses, on the firths in Ross-shire, at Dun near
Montrose, around the upper end of the Firths of
Tay and Forth, are all of nearly equal level, about
20 feet above the highest stream-tides. The gravel
bar at Montrose is considerably above the present
sea-level. A number of caves
exist on this <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
eastern coast, evidently worn into the rock by the
action of the sea at the height where the waves have
broken. These caves have nearly one level, corresponding
in height with that of the carses. There
are also many places where the coast has been shorn
away by the action of the waves, and a shelf of rocks
left extending out some hundred paces. This abrasion,
which takes place nearly at, or a little above, low
water-mark, is effected by innumerable hard pebbles
(the most indurated parts of the rocks which give
way being converted into battering material for further
reduction), being upborne and dashed against
the rock by the continuous heaving and lashing of
the waves. Wherever any breach commences from
the feebler opposition of any softer part, the action
of the waves and battering train proceeds with increased
impetus and concentration, especially if the
breach be wedge-shaped narrowing inward, thence
caves of considerable extent are hallowed out. The
rocks thus abraded and undermined, tumble down
and are ground into sand, which is swept by the
tides and motion of the waters into the depths of
the ocean, or borne along to the upper end of the
bays, or to some part of the coast where more sluggish
lateral tides, and particular motion of the waves
leave it and throw it ashore to be
blown up into <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span>
downs. There are some former islands which have
been altogether shorn down to this sea-level, of
which the Bell-Rock, extending nearly a mile of
shelf, affords a well known specimen. In many places
of the coast, these shelves accord with the superior
former level of the sea, and with the floors of the
caves.</p>

<p>In proof of the sea having advanced upon the
land, there are vestiges of submerged forests (the
stumps of the trees standing erect where they grew,
at or a little above the present lowest ebb) existing
at different places on the eastern coast, both of
England and Scotland, and these vestiges standing
upon a former carse or alluvium of the rivers, are
visible in the same firths with the upper level of carse,
of course generally more to seaward than these higher
carses, as deposition of rivers occurs at what may be
termed deposition point, that is where the rivers,
from the stemming of the sea-water, begin to widen—where
the firths commence; and the slowness of
the motion of the water gives time for the subsidence
of the floated mud. By reason of the flux
and reflux of the tide into the mouths of rivers, this
deposition takes place only at or near high water,
that is, when the strength of the inward tide-flux
ceases, and before that of the reflux
begins. It is <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span>
most abundant at the windward shore, or where
there is least surf, and among the tall gramina and
other vegetation where there is least undulation and
current; the deposition which occurs at this time,
some distance below high water level, is floated away
by the current of the following flux and reflux,
unless some object afford a nucleus of formation.
Hence deltas or carses usually form near the shore
of firths, generally soon rise to high-water level,
and have often steep, or even abrupt, banks, collecting
at one place, and giving way before the waves
and undermining current at another. There is a deposition
of another kind than river diluvium, which
also takes place at the bottom, or further end, of bays
and firths, and is sometimes mixed with the preceding:
This consists, as mentioned above, of the
abrasion of the rocks, or shores of the bay and neighbouring
coast, and also of molluscous exuviæ, borne
along by the motion of the waters; but this is generally
rather an accumulation than a deposition,
occurring in greatest quantity where a heavy swell
rolls dead in.</p>

<p>Although we have pretty accurate proof that the
present elevation of the German Sea has remained
nearly steady for several hundred years, yet our new
formation of carse, at the
present high-water level, <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span>
bears a small proportion to the extent of the upper
carse; from which may be inferred, either that the
sea has remained a shorter time at the present level,
or that some general cause has more recently operated
to diminish the deposition, such as inferiority
of present climate not producing so much littoral
vegetation,—tides or higher winds preventing subsidence
by greater undulation or current, till the
diffused mud be carried out to sea<a class="afnanc" href="#fn59" id="fnm59">59</a>. The junction
of the higher and present sea-level carses, abrupt
and always definite, that is, not gradually declining
from the one to the other, would seem to indicate a
quick subsiding of the sea, or rising of the land,
such as has been known to result from subterraneous
derangement. The very accurate level of these carses
proves, that this portion of the world has remained
a very long time pretty free from these disturbances,
recently so prevalent in some other quarters; and
if the change of sea-level has been owing to such
disturbance, it follows, from the extent and regularity
of the upheaving or subsidence, that the cause
must have been very deep seated, or of great magnitude.</p>

<p>We begin to think, from our disposition to ramble
from the Allanton system, that we
tire of Sir <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
Henry; and we believe, should <i>he</i> follow us thus
far, that he will be tired of us. On looking back on
what we have written, we are almost disposed to accuse
ourselves of being splenetic; but the truth is,
we regard the whole art as very unimportant, if not
positively pernicious, at least in the way in which it
has been exemplified by Sir Henry, as a throwing
away of valuable labour to no purpose, if it ought
not indeed to be considered as a mere pander to
luxury and caprice. We have no sympathy with
the aristocratical object of the book, and as little
with the aristocratical tone in which it has been bepraised
by Sir Walter Scott. We should also have
no greater pleasure in the discovery of a royal road
to virtue than we should have to the discovery of
one to science,—the four cardinal virtues being, as
every body knows, writing books, building houses,
and raising trees and children, but we should hope,
neither by proxy, nor by the <i>Allanton System</i>.
While, however, we thus state our opinions with
freedom, we do not hesitate to add, that Sir Henry’s
volume has afforded us more information, or, at least,
more materials for reflection, than any other of the
works which we have brought under the notice of
our readers. <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span></p>

<hr class="hr34" />

<p>We shall finish our remarks on Sir Henry’s work,
by making some observations upon a quotation made
by Sir Henry Steuart, from “A Treatise on the
Forming and Improving of Country Residences,”
by the Author of the Encyclopædia of Gardening,
&amp;c.—an author, who combines talent, successful industry,
and enlightened benevolence, in no common
degree. We are sorry to appear before this author,
whom we have long esteemed, in opposition; yet we
regret the less, as we consider him one of the few
who prefer accuracy and truth to an old opinion, and
whose name stands too high to be affected by a
casual misconception.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The general effects of pruning,” says this author,
as quoted by Sir Henry Steuart, “is of a corresponding
nature with culture, that is, to increase
the quantity of timber-produce: the particular manner
in which it does this is by directing the greater
part of the sap, which generally spreads itself into
side branches, into the principal stem. This must
consequently enlarge the stem in a more than ordinary
degree, by increasing the annual circles of the
wood. Now, if the tree be <i>in a worse soil and climate
than those which are natural to it, this will
be of some advantage</i>, as the extra
increase of <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span>
timber will still be of a quality <i>not inferior</i> to what
would take place in its natural state; or, in other
words, it will correspond with that degree of quality
and quantity of timber, which the nature and
species of the tree admit of being produced. If the
tree be in its natural state, the annual increase of
timber occasioned by pruning, must necessarily <i>injure
its quality</i> in a degree corresponding with the
increased quantity. If the tree be in a better climate
and soil than that which is natural to it, and
at the same time the annual increase of wood be promoted
by pruning, it is evident that such wood must
be of <i>a very different quality</i> from that produced in
its natural state (that is <i>very inferior</i>).”—“<i>Whatever
tends to increase the wood in a greater degree
than what is natural to the species when in
its natural state, must injure the quality of the timber.</i>
Pruning tends to increase this in a considerable
degree, and therefore it must be a <i>pernicious
practice</i>.”—“Mr Knight has shown, in a very striking
manner, that timber is produced, or rather that
the alburnum or sap-wood is rendered ligneous, by
the motion of the tree, during the descent of the
tree (or proper) sap. It is also sufficiently known,
that the solid texture of the wood greatly depends
upon the quantity of sap
which must necessarily <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
descend, and also on the slowness of the descent.
Now, both these requisites are materially increased
by side-branches, which retain a large quantity of
sap, and, by their junction with the stem, occasion a
contraction and twisted direction of the vessels, which
obstructs the progress of the (proper) sap. Of maple
and birch, those trees which have fewest side-branches
bleed more freely than the other, but during
a much shorter space of time. These hints,
therefore, afford additional evidence against pruning,
and particularly against pruning fir trees, which, as
Mr Knight justly observes, have larger vessels than
the others, and therefore, when in an improved soil
and climate, side-branches for the purposes above
mentioned are essentially necessary to them, if solid,
resinous, and durable timber be the object in view.</p>

<p>“From the foregoing remarks, I think the following
conclusions may be drawn.</p>

<p>“First, That trees should be planted as much as
possible in soils, situations, and climates, <i>analogous
to those of their natural state</i>; and that it is chiefly
in this state, or when there are some defects relative
to it, that pruning or culture can be exercised
with advantage. <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span></p>

<p>“Secondly, That in proportion to the superiority
of the soil, &amp;c. in which trees are placed, over the
natural soil of these trees, in the same proportion
pruning and cultivating the soil ought to be avoided,
and thinning encouraged.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, That particular regard should be had
to the soil and situation, where either larches, or any
other of the pine tribe, are planted, to remain as the
final crop. For as the roots of these chiefly run
along the surface, and as in them the great current
of the sap is chiefly confined to one channel, that is
the trunk, consequently that tribe of trees is peculiarly
liable to injury and change, when subjected to
unnatural agency.</p>

<p>“Fourthly, That the only way in which oak timber
of safe quality can be provided for the British
navy, is by enclosing, preserving from cattle, and
properly managing, those royal forests where oak is
the natural produce of the soil. (Alas! there is
reason to fear, that on some future day the neglect
of this advice will be regretted). Park oak is very
frequently much inferior to <i>forest oak</i> in durability.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We differ from the author of the Encyclopædia
of Gardening here, even <i>in limine</i>,
in his <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span>
assumption, that pruning is of a corresponding nature with
culture, in increasing the annual circles of the
wood<a class="afnanc" href="#fn60" id="fnm60">60</a>. Culture, if judiciously executed, increases
these annual circles; but common pruning up (which,
from the general bearing of the language, we suppose
is meant), nine times out of ten diminishes them,
and merely tends to extend the stem in length, by
throwing all the new formation of branches to the
top of the tree, in place of partly to the sides. Thence
the tree acquires a slenderer figure, and more delicate
constitution; and from greater height, and
being without cover of side-branches, loses more by
evaporation, and receives less moisture from the
ground, which is dried by the breeze passing along
under the branches; the principal process of vegetation,
assimilation by the leaves, being reduced
by the pruning, and carried on at an unnatural
height, in a colder less genial atmosphere, under a
diminished supply of nourishment from the ground,
is consequently less productive of new assimilized <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span>
matter; and this smaller quantity requiring to be
extended along a greater length of stem, the annual
rings are necessarily thinner.</p>

<p>We admit that a tree becomes more <i>stemmy</i> by
being repeatedly pruned up;—we admit, that, on
removal of the lower branches, the upper part of the
stem may have, for a few seasons, larger annual circles;
but the annual circles will be diminished in thickness
in a much greater proportion on the lower part
of the stem;—we admit, that the timber, from being
deposited in a clean lengthened cylinder, becomes far
more useful, there being less redundant matter than
when scattered out into <i>stemmy</i> branches, to which
disposition, trees in open situation sometimes incline,
especially if not transplanted very young,
but to which they are nevertheless much more disposed
under the common mode of pruning in an early
stage of their growth, than when left to themselves;—we
admit, that trees, by pruning, raised to lengthened
stem, and thence performing less assimilation,
partly compensate for this less assimilation, for some
time, by making more stem deposit in proportion to
the other deposit, which extends the parts more immediately
necessary to new formation,—the roots
and twigs; but the deficiency of
productory parts soon <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span>
reacts to diminish the amount of <i>all</i> the new products.
In tall trees, this greater deposition on the
stem, in proportion to that on the roots, twigs, and
leaves, some will think instinctive; some will refer
it to an effort of nature to supply the necessary
strength to enable the stem to resist the great strain
of the winds upon the elevated top. If it take place
to a greater extent than what arises from the greater
elongation of the necessary vessels of communication,
perhaps it is owing to the evaporation or stagnation
of the sap on the tall exposed stem, and to the considerable
motion or waving of the stem by wind promoting
deposition, evincing one of the deep balancings
of material cause and effect, or circumstantial
regulation, which mocks the wisdom of the wise.
We admit, also, that pruning, in the first place, impedes
formation of flower-buds, and will sometimes
thus prevent exhaustion of trees by seeding, which
is so prejudicial both to the quality and quantity
of the new wood deposit; but the consequent greater
length of stem, greater exposure to evaporation,
constriction of bark, and slenderer connecting tubes
between leaf and roots, all tend subsequently to promote
formation of flower-buds, although the removal
of the lower branches may for a few
seasons serve to <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
prevent this. We therefore consider pruning, excepting
in a very slight degree, to guide to one leader,
and to remove the sickly, lower, moss-covered
branches a few seasons earlier than they would have
dropped off in the common course of decay, to be generally
preventive of quantity of wood-deposit, even
of common marketable timber, in any considerable
number of years, although pruning to a greater degree
is often necessary where fine clean timber is required.</p>

<p>Our author’s next implied assumption, that a tree
produces best timber in a soil and climate <i>natural</i>
to it (we suppose by this is meant the soil and climate
where the kind of tree is naturally found growing),
is, we think, at least exceedingly hypothetical; and,
judging from our facts, incorrect. The natural soil
and climate of a tree, is often very far from being the
soil and climate most suited to its growth, <i>and is only
the situation where it has greater power of occupancy,
than any other plant whose germ is present</i>.
The pines do not cover the pine barrens of
America, because they prefer such soil, or grow most
luxuriant in such soil; they would thrive much better,
that is, grow faster, in the natural allotment of
the oak and the walnut, <i>and also mature to a
better wood in this deeper richer
soil</i>. But the <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span>
oak and the walnut banish them to inferior soil from
greater power of occupancy in good soil, as the pines,
in their turn, banish other plants from inferior sands—some
to still more sterile location, by the same
means of greater powers of occupancy in these sands.
One cause considerably affecting the natural location
of certain kinds of plants is, that only certain
soils are suited to the preservation of certain seeds,
throughout the winter or wet season. Thus many
plants, different from those which naturally occupy
the soil, would feel themselves at home, and would
beat off intruders, were they once seated. We have
had indubitable proof in this country, that <i>Scots
fir, grown upon good deep loam, and strong till</i>
(what our author would call the natural soil of the
oak), <i>is of much better quality, and more resinous,
than fir grown on poor sand</i> (what he would call
the natural soil of the Scots fir), although of more
rapid growth on the loam than on the sand; and the
best Scots fir we have ever seen, of equal age and
quickness of growth, is growing upon Carse land
(clayey alluvium).</p>

<p>The reason that Scots fir is of better quality, and
more resinous, on good loam and moist till, than on
poor siliceous ground, may probably be, that the
loam contains more oleaginous
matter, and other <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
vegetable products which bear a near relation to resinous,
and which, transmitted upwards from the
roots, may occasion richer assimilated juices. Men
fed upon whale or seal blubber, if the digestion is
good, have much fatty deposit upon the body, and
the perspired fluid is oil. It is a fact well known to
every intelligent farmer, that <i>infield</i> or <i>croft</i> land,
that is land, which, having been earliest cultivated,
was, of course, the best soil at first, and which has
also been long highly manured at the cost of the
<i>outfield</i>, and therefore containing much oleaginous
and other matter, products of organization,
produces grasses and other vegetables much more
nutritive to cattle than the <i>outfield</i>, even though
these vegetables be of the same species, and by reason
of more careful culture of those of the <i>outfield</i>,
also of the same size of plant. We have also considered
that light, poor sandy soil, which throws up
a considerable flush of vegetation in the spring, partly
because it has then sufficient moisture, but which
almost entirely gives over producing throughout the
latter part of the summer, partly because the winter’s
moisture is exhausted, may throw out the frame
or skeleton of a considerable growth, or annual layer
of wood, in the early part of the season, but may not
afford sufficient matter for the filling
up or <span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span>
maturing the layer into good dense timber later in the
season, when the assimilated fluid or sap is believed
to descend.</p>

<p>Our author states, that the timber of pruned trees
must be inferior to that of trees with many side-branches,
because the consequent contracting and
twisting of the vessels as they pass the junction of
the branches and stem, obstruct the descent of the
sap, thence the timber is better matured, and in firs
has more of resinous deposit. We admit that the
resinous deposition is more abundant in knots and in
some of the parts adjacent; but the timber is not
better throughout. Worm-eating may be observed
to commence generally in the neighbourhood of
knots. Although one part of the wood, in consequence
of the obstruction of the knot, be more
dense and resinous, another part, immediately above
or below the knot, where the growths are extended
to fill up the vacant space, where the worming
commences, is less dense, and of inferior durability,
and corruption begun, extends. The knotted
timber, of course, is very inferior in strength and value
to the clean. We would refer the longer continued
flow of sap from maple and birches, which
have many side-branches, in part, to the lower or
side-branches commencing to vegetate
sooner in the <span class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span>
spring than the top of the tree; this successive commencement
of vegetation prolonging the bleeding.</p>

<p>Again, in larch, we find that by far the hardest
and most durable wood is grown upon poor, hard,
thin tills (that is, thin of vegetable mould upon the
diluvium), even where the root-rot commences about
thirty years of age. Now, we ask, is this the natural
soil of larches? We have not, however, found larch
from rich loam, of better quality than from poor sand,
as we have observed in Scots fir. We also consider
larch, grown on a proper larch soil—on sound soil and
subsoil, or sound rock, common in acclivous situation—superior
in quality to larch of equal quickness
of growth, raised on rich loam or sand, though not
equal to larch of slow growth from the above mentioned
poor tills.</p>

<p>We would ask how our author is enabled to
assume, as an axiom, that trees produce the best
timber in their natural locality? We would also
desire some <i>rational</i> information to shew in what
manner pruning up can in any way conduce generally,
to the increase of the timber, or to the enlargement
of one-stemmed vegetables. A tree naturally
rises in one stem. It throws out its branches
in the disposition most favourable to draw the fullest
benefit from the light and air. It of
its own <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
accord (that is when man does not meddle), gradually
raises its pyramidal centre, with proportional lateral
spread, as high as is befitting, for the fullest expansion
of the individual, under the circumstances of
its location. Man may mar this beautiful natural
balance easier than decypher the proximate cause
he may throw the new deposit of wood in greater
proportion upon the upper part of the stem, rendering
his beam more suitable from equality of thickness,
and particularly in pines, of cleaner, smaller
growthed, more durable timber, thence more valuable.
But the tree will neither produce the same
quantity of measurable timber in a considerable
number of years, nor will it ultimately reach to nearly
the same size, nor continue life nearly so long,
as when left to itself. Man’s interference is useful
in removing competitors, in giving it lateral
room for extension, in <i>training</i> it skilfully to one
leader and subordinate equality of feeders, should
transplanting, early pruning up, or other cause, destroy
the natural regular pyramidal disposition—not
in pruning it up, thus reducing it to narrower compass,
and destroying its balance to the locality.</p>

<p>The use of the infinite seedling varieties in the
families of plants, even in those in a state of nature,
differing in luxuriance of growth
and local adaptation, <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span>
seems to be to give one individual (the strongest
best circumstance-suited) superiority over others of
its kind around, that it may, by overtopping and
smothering them, procure room for full extension,
and thus affording, at the same time, a continual
selection of the strongest, best circumstance-suited,
for reproduction. Man’s interference, by preventing
this natural process of selection among plants,
independent of the wider range of circumstances to
which he introduces them, has increased the difference
in varieties, particularly in the more domesticated
kinds; and even in man himself, the greater
uniformity, and more general vigour among savage
tribes, is referrible to nearly similar selecting law—the
weaker individual sinking under the ill treatment
of the stronger, or under the common hardship.</p>

<p>As our author’s premises thus appear neither self-evident,
nor supported by facts, it might seem unfair, at least it
would be superfluous, to proceed to the consideration of his
conclusions and corollaries.</p>

<p>After the preceding parts of this volume had
gone to press, we received a copy of Cruickshank’s
Practical Planter. We endeavour to give a short
view of the contents.</p></div>

<p>The author commences with some general remarks
on the expediency and profit of laying uncultivated
ground under timber, stating, rather too
strongly, the very superior income derivable from
forest than from heathy moors, and its advantages to
the soil. No doubt, a great portion of the higher and
more rocky part of Scotland is susceptible of little
other improvement than planting; and, under timber,
would produce more than ten times the income
that it does in pasture; and the patriotic motive of
embellishing his country, and enriching his countrymen,
may excuse his having drawn the advantages
of planting in rather high colours. Mr Cruickshank’s
statement (as he says, designedly kept rather
below the truth), that an acre of moor, of average
quality, covered with Scotch
fir, sixty years <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span>
planted, would contain 600 trees, value 10s. each,
differs considerably from what has come within our
experience. The timber of an acre of Scotch fir,
sixty years planted in such waste ground as occurs
in the valley of the Tay, will not average much more
than one hundred pounds per acre on the spot, and
laid down on the quay at Newcastle (the place to
which the greater part of the Scotch fir on the east
of Scotland is carried), would not produce L. 300
per acre.</p>

<p>In order the more to encourage planting, Mr
Cruickshank runs into a speculative statement of the
fertilizing influence of planting upon the soil, in rather
a novel manner, leaving out the particular facts,
which, he says, had come under his own observation,
and adducing one as proof, furnished to him by
another person unnamed. We have often had occasion
to see ground, which had produced a crop of firs,
brought under tillage without any marked fertility
beyond the adjacent fields which had been under proper
rotation of cropping, certainly inferior to what had
lain for the same length of time in natural grass pasture.
There is a particular instance in a slight rising
ground (diluvial soil) in the Carse of Gowrie,
where the fields, since the rooting out of the fir-wood,
have not paid seed and labour in
corn, though <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
under regular manuring and rotation. There are even
varieties of pine, such as the loblolly, which are known
to have an influence upon the soil where they grow
poisonous to succeeding crops. Mr Cruickshank
himself adverts several times to ground which had
produced a crop of timber, being <i>boss</i> (hollow) from
the roots remaining in the soil, and owing to this
hollowness being unsuited for replanting till the
roots were removed or consumed. We do not very
well comprehend this hollowness, and ascribe the unsuitableness
for replanting immediately, rather to
exhaustion, or to the formation of something inimical
to vegetation, than to any hollowness or manner
of arrangement of the soil.</p>

<p>As the causes which promote or retard the formation,
or which tend to dissipate the earth’s covering
of vegetable mould—a covering, on the richness or
thickness of which the fertility of ground, as well for
most kinds of naval timber as for other products, is
so much dependent, though of the greatest importance—have
never, that we are aware of, been generally
brought into view, we shall devote some space
to their consideration.</p>

<p>In the first place, to give a fair specimen of our
author, we shall transcribe several
pages where he <span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
has treated this subject with some ingenuity, and on
which he appears to have bestowed considerable care.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Those who have never had an opportunity of
seeing old woodlands brought into cultivation, will
scarce credit what has now been advanced, that the
soil should be enriched by the production of wood,
when the experience of ages has proved that it is
always exhausted by other crops.”—“Trees draw their
nourishment from a much greater depth than any
of the grasses, roots, or different kinds of grain raised
by the agriculturist. Most of the latter derive the
whole of their subsistence from the part of the soil
that lies within a few inches of the surface; but the
former, from the superior strength and magnitude
of their roots, are enabled to penetrate much farther,
and extract food from the very rock which forms the
substratum of a great portion, both of our cultivated
and uncultivated grounds. This, though it
does not account for lands being positively enriched
by wood, makes it, at the same time, far less surprizing
that trees should grow to a large size, and yet
not exhaust the upper part of the soil in so great
a degree as most of the crops
cultivated by the farmer.</p>

<p>“There is another circumstance which gives
ground in wood a great advantage over
that in <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
tillage, which is, that the leaves of the trees are suffered
to decay and rot where they fall, and, by this means,
an annual addition is made to the depth of the vegetable
mould. Now, the leaves of a tree may be
considered as bearing the same proportion to the
trunk and branches, in respect to the nourishment
which they require, as the straw of corn bears to the
grain. But the manure which cultivated land receives,
is, in general, little more than the straw
which grows on it after it has served for food or litter
to cattle. Ground in wood, then, actually receives,
in the annual fall of the leaves, as much enrichment
as the farmer bestows on his land under
tillage.</p>

<p>“Ground employed in agriculture is exposed at
almost every season of the year to the full action of
the atmosphere; and in the drought and heat of
summer, much of its strength is evaporated. In
land covered with wood, the case is entirely different,
as from the shade afforded by the leaves and branches,
very little evaporation takes place. This, then,
is another reason that serves in some measure, at
least, to explain the seemingly paradoxical fact in
question. For, that evaporation has a very powerful
tendency to exhaust land, by drawing off and dissipating
the more volatile part of
the matter which <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
assists in the process of vegetation, there can be no
doubt, when we consider that any kind of dung may
be deprived of the greater part of its strength by
being long exposed to a dry atmosphere. Nor is it
merely by preserving its own original substance that
land in wood has the advantage of cultivated ground.
Whatever is extracted from the latter in the form
of vapour, falls again, when condensed, in the shape
of rain or dew; but, instead of descending wholly
on the same spots from whence it rose, it is, of course,
diffused over the whole space which the clouds, containing
it, may happen to cover, and woods and
moors have as good a chance of receiving it on its
return to the earth, as the ground in tillage. The
part of it which falls, either on the cultivated fields
or the naked wastes, may be again evaporated before
it has time to be productive of any benefit; but
the portion of it which the woodlands imbibe is retained
to enrich the soil; for, the umbrage excluding
the rays of the sun, there is no possibility of its
being extracted a second time. Land covered with
trees, therefore, while it never loses any thing, receives,
with every fall of rain, or of dew, a tribute from
the riches of the cultivated part of the country. The
advantage derived from this source is greater than will
be credited by those who are not
aware how much <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span>
of the substances proper for vegetable nutriment are
exhaled from the land in a gaseous state during the
dry season of the year.</p>

<p>“But the principal way in which wood becomes
instrumental in enriching land still remains to be noticed.
When trees attain a certain size, they attract
multitudes of birds, which build their nests and seek
shelter among the branches. The dung of these animals
is the very richest kind of manure which can
be applied to land, and possesses, at least, three
times the strength of that commonly used in agriculture.
The quantity of it produced during the
long series of years which trees require to reach maturity
is, especially where large colonies of crows take
up their abode, very considerable, and must have a
powerful influence in improving and fertilizing the
soil.</p>

<p>“I ought not to omit here to mention, among the
causes why ground is improved by producing wood—the
minuteness into which its particles are divided
by the roots and their fibres. On taking up a young
tree, or even a gooseberry bush, and shaking the
earth from its roots, we find the mould that falls
from it as completely reduced to powder, as if it had
been passed through a fine sieve.
Now, the fact <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span>
seems undoubted, that land is much increased in fertility
by being brought to this state.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether a greater accumulation of vegetable
mould or enriching of the soil, would take place under
a system of rotation of crops, stirring of the
ground, and manuring, or under Nature’s own system
of management—whether, under forest, or under
the rich leafy grasses depastured by cattle, is a
question of the greatest intricacy, and only admits
of local decision, being dependent upon climate, soil,
and circumstance. From our author’s statements, it
would appear that his mind had only ranged along
the surface of the subject. He has not taken into
account the quantity of root which herbaceous vegetables
annually leave in the ground—in some kinds
little inferior in bulk to the portion above ground.
We have traced oat and wheat roots running down
into clay five and six feet (as deep as those of many
kinds of trees), extremely numerous, and fine as human
hair. He seems not aware that the bulk of
yearly vegetable produce is much increased by culture,
alternate cropping, and extraneous manure, such
as lime, mixture of earths, sea-ware, bones. He has
not considered that the annual dead roots within the
soil, and the vegetable and animal
manure, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
sward and the stubble ploughed down, conduce much
more to enrich and thicken the soil than the tree
leaves, blown about by the winds, and nearly dissipated
into air, before the residuum fixes as a part of the
soil; and also that ploughing is often beneficial to
shallow soils, by mixing the thin covering of mould
with the pure earth of the subsoil,—the vegetable soil-matter,
from consequent deeper cover, and more equable
moisture, not losing so much by evaporation, and
at the same time being more efficacious as nutriment
to the vegetation. He seems unacquainted with the
fact, that the matter of wood and tree-leaves, especially
of the resinous kinds, and those containing
much tannin, if not actually pernicious, have very little
fertilizing effect—saw-dust has generally no manuring
influence, but turns into peat. He also appears
to be ignorant, that some kinds of vegetables draw
more from the air and water, and others more from
the earth; and, especially, that vegetables in a moist
climate, depastured or cut before maturity, exhaust
the soil much less than when allowed to seed. In
Britain, soils, particularly those of good quality, become
richer, and thicken more under pasturage, than
under any other common vegetation. This is owing
to the manuring of the cattle—to the natural grasses
not being what is termed
scourging plants, especially <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span>
when not allowed to seed—to the complete cover of
the ground by the leaves—to the quantity of root
which dies annually—and to the mould thrown up
by the red earth-worm, renovating the surface, and
partly covering the moss and decayed leaves and old
bulbs. It is a curious fact, that, under pasturage,
fertility should increase in Britain and diminish in
Australia. An uncropt deep cover of grass appears
necessary to shelter the vegetable soil-matter during
the arid heat, and even to protect the roots from
being burned out, in the latter country. And the
manure of cattle, instead of being covered by the
luxuriant herbage before it is desiccated, and enriching
the soil as in England, is, in New South Wales,
under the powerful sun and arid air, quickly reduced
to dust and dissipated.</p>

<p>The fertility of soils may also be quickly increased,
and the vegetable cover thickened almost to any extent
under tillage, by first rearing a quantity of large
growing annual vegetables, and when nearly full extended,
burying this green vegetable produce in drills,
resowing the ground immediately with another fast
growing kind, and proceeding thus continuedly.</p>

<p>The influence of birds in enriching forest soil, is
exceedingly limited, and is chiefly perceptible, not
in continued forest, but in some
detached portions or <span class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span>
clumps of park trees, which colonies of rooks or other
large birds frequent.</p>

<p>Of the natural grass which Mr Cruickshank states
succeeds in woods to the original heaths, and which
he describes as affording such excellent tender food
for cattle, we can only say, that either the woods
must have been unprofitably thin, and the trees
naked, or that he has completely mistaken the quality
of the herbage. The grass of woods is unhealthy
food for cattle, and generally not relished, being
rendered unpalatable and noxious by the resinous
and bitter droppings from the tree leaves, and by
the bitter and nauseous juices generated in the soil by
the roots of trees, which the herbage roots draw up.
In dry soils, there is sometimes an accumulation of
whitish substance within the ground, around the
roots of trees, which some refer to excrementitious
deposit<a class="afnanc" href="#fn61" id="fnm61">61</a>, but which, we think, is rather the produce
of a subterraneous vegetable, of the nature of a
fungus or mould. Wherever this has increased to
a considerable extent, we believe old forest ground
will be found of great fertility. <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span></p>

<p>The friability and minute division of the soil to
which Mr Cruickshanks refers, existing around the
bulbs of trees, can only be of utility where the soil is
too adhesive. Light soil is often injured by being
cropped by plants which tend greatly to reduce adhesion—what
the farmer styles being <i>driven</i>: besides,
all luxuriant annual crops render adhesive soils
friable; and, remaining for a time under natural
grass, gives what is termed a turfiness to soils, which
continues for several years, and which renders both
adhesive and light soils more productive, preventing
the adhesive from sinking down into mortar under
cultivation, and the light from losing all adhesion or
granular arrangement.</p>

<p>There is, no doubt, a disposition to accumulate
vegetable deposit in forests, from the moistness, coolness
of the ground, and shade, not tending so much
as the sunshine and exposure of open country to dissipate
or volatilize the residuum of the decayed
leaves and roots. In a lower latitude, beyond the
line of peat formation, this will have some influence
to increase the depth and richness of the vegetable
mould; but, in Scotland, where cold till bottom prevails,
more injury will result from forest tending to
throw the debri of vegetation into combinations unfavourable
to the nourishment of plants
(such as peat <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span>
and compounds in which iron forms a part), than advantage,
from the dead vegetable matter not being
so much dissipated by aration and exposure to the
sun. We have often observed the effect of remaining
for a length of time in a state of considerable
dryness, dissipating the vegetable part of the soil, in
some of the old infield clays, where the crown of the
large ridges are raised up a foot or two above the original
surface-level. At the crown of the ridge, the
vegetable clay mould often only extends down about
nine inches from the surface, the subsoil immediately
under being nearly void of vegetable matter, and
extremely close tenacious clay,—a solid foot of it,
though of equal moistness, being nearly double the
weight of the same bulk of the vegetable clay mould
above it. From this clay, almost purely mineral,
being a little above the original surface-level, there
can be no doubt, that at one time it consisted of the
vegetable surface mould of the country, heaped up
by repeated ploughings, and that it has gradually
lost the vegetable part. The depth of vegetable soil,
near the furrows of the ridges, is generally found to
be greater than at the ridge crown.</p>

<p>The same dissipation of vegetable matter takes
place when a ditch has been dug in
clay ground, and <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span>
the excavated earth thrown up to form a dike on
one side. On removal of the dike, the original surface,
which no doubt, at the time the dike was
formed, consisted of vegetable clay mould similar to
the surface around, is always found to be close, heavy,
poor clay, containing little or no carbonaceous or
vegetable matter. In this case, from the draining
effect of the ditch, the original surface under the
dike must have been drier than the subsoil of the
crowns of the ridges.</p>

<p>The difference of depth and richness of vegetable
mould, may nearly always be referred to existing
causes, such as the original surface (diluvium, or decayed
rock), being a combination of earths favourable
to vegetation; occupying a genial situation; being
favourably placed with regard to moisture, that is, less
or more moist, according as the original surface has
been clayey or sandy, or open or close bottomed; and
is in no way connected with those flood torrents to
which we owe the diluvium deposits themselves—tills,
sand and gravel, in which we have never found
any vegetable matter, excepting in the coaly or mineralized
state.</p>

<p>Unless in the case of alluvium, or of drift sand,
or where surface earth has been
rolled down from <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
heights, or been <i>forced</i> by man<a class="afnanc" href="#fn62" id="fnm62">62</a>, soil is seldom found
to exceed 6 feet in depth, and that only in warm
moist situations, propitious to vegetation. In Scotland
we never have seen it exceed 3 or 4 feet in
depth where its accumulation had not been aided by
the above causes. The most common depth is from
6 inches to 2 feet; but, in many of our sterile districts,
the surface hardly deserves the name of mould,
containing very little vegetable matter, or that matter
being unavailable from the presence of tannin.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact, that summer-fallowing always
dissipates a portion of the vegetable matter in
the soil, although it may, at the same time, tend to
fertility, especially in adhesive soils, and where the
climate is not very arid and warm, overbalancing the
loss from dissipation by the advantage resulting from
aëration and absorption of gases and heat, and the
sun’s rays; by the mechanical disposition and comminution
from being thoroughly dried and then moistened;
and, probably, by the formation
of salts, <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span>
stimulative to vegetation; or, as it has been thought, by
the resting for a season. In the case of any tannin
or inert vegetable matter existing in the soil, the
heat and drying will tend to reduce these to a condition
suitable for vegetable food. In the West Indies,
when a summer fallowing is resorted to in order
to get clear of the weeds, the fertility of the ground is
considerably lessened, from the evaporation or burning
out of the putrescent or carbonaceous matter.
Were the fallowing continued for several successive
seasons, there is no doubt that the whole matter,
which, combined with earth, forms mould, would be
dissipated.</p>

<p>About a century ago, it was the practice, in our
neighbourhood (an alluvial clay district), to build up
the soil of the fallow division, furrow deep, into thin
dikes, or walls, about 5 feet high. This was done
in early summer. After being dried and aërated by
the summer’s drought, the dikes were levelled down
in the autumn and sown with wheat. This system
was considered so fertilizing as to counterbalance
the labour and the loss of a crop.</p>

<p>Our own practice has proven that there is scarcely
any manure more effective for one crop, particularly
of spring sowing, than the clay of old
mud walls of <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
houses, though applied in no larger quantity than is
usually given of farm-yard manure, and though the
clay appear quite free from vegetable matter. It is
improbable that the resting of the clay from production
could have any effect to occasion this fertility.
We considered it to arise chiefly from a quantity of
nitre having been formed in, or deposited about, the
walls from their long proximity to animal effluvia
and to atmospheric air. The fertilizing effect of the
dike system of summer-fallow, and even of the present
system, may also depend in part on the formation
of nitre, well known to be a powerful manure or
stimulant in this country. In dry seasons we have
scraped together handfuls of salts, partly nitre, from
the exposed surface of clay-banks. Should a considerable
part of the fertilizing effect of fallowing arise
from the formation of nitre, the application of lime
and putrescent manures to fallows, in the early part
of summer, will be advantageous, as the presence of
both are favourable to the formation of nitre. Of
course, the utility of encouraging the formation<a class="afnanc" href="#fn63" id="fnm63">63</a> of <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span>
nitre or other salts, combinations of potassa or of
soda, will depend on the climate, whether much or
little rain falls, and whether the rain water goes off
by evaporation or by drainage. In the case of little
rain, or the rain-water being nearly all evaporated,
nitre and other salts will accumulate in the soil, so
as, from their excess, to be injurious to vegetation;
whereas, should much rain fall, or the rain-water be
chiefly carried off by drainage, vegetation may languish
from deficiency of these salts, there being less
deposition of the salts, or the salts as they form being
washed away. The same will apply to the graminivorous
animals. Sea-salt, perhaps also nitre and
other salts, will be serviceable in a moist country, or
far from the sea, where the plants and water contain
little saline matter, and probably pernicious in a dry
climate, where the plants and water generally contain
much saline matter.</p>

<p>In the portion of the earth from the Atlantic
eastward, through Numidia, Libya, Egypt, Nubia,
Arabia, Persia, as far as the Indus, from the enormous
ruins, and other vestiges of dense population,
as well as from ancient records,
there must have <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
existed a considerable depth of vegetable mould covering,
where now little is left but pure sand, baked
clay, bare rock, and saline encrustations. From the
footing which an industrious and brave nation has
recently so honourably acquired in this territory, may
we not hope that the tide of arid sterility, dissipating
the vegetable covering, will be turned, and that
through European enterprise and mechanical science,
by means of steam and wind power, a system of irrigation
will be introduced which will reanimate this
dead portion of the earth—spreading forth again
perpetual spring, strewing the desert all over with
herbs, and fruits, and flowers, converting the sirocco
into a breeze loaded with fragrance, and reproducing,
in profusion, all the delights of the gardens of Hesperus?
From the carbonaceous or soil-matter being
burned out, and from the quantity of saline deposit,
a very considerable time will, however, elapse before
production be generally extended, and the desert so
far circumscribed, and the ground cooled so much, as
to condense a sufficiency of rain and dew, that a new
vegetable mould cover may be formed.</p>

<p>But to return from our wide exclusion, we observe,
that Mr Cruickshank states, page 25, “that any
land that is proper for Scots fir will be found to answer
well with the larch.”
This observation, with <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
what he says of larch “being heavier in proportion
to its bulk” than Scots fir, and that “spruce is
very easily wrought, and tries the carpenter’s tools
less than any other kind of wood used in building,”
would lead us to suspect that our author has had a
very limited acquaintance with his subject. A number
of different soils will produce large Scots fir where
larches will be generally rotted and hollow in the
heart, by twenty years of age<a class="afnanc" href="#fn64" id="fnm64">64</a>. This ignorance of
our author is the more glaring, as it
is coupled with <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
some severe strictures on planters in general for <i>their
ignorance</i> of the proper location of trees. He says,
“Scots fir, on soils of a fertile character, is short
lived, and the excellence of its timber is in proportion
to the slowness of its growth.” This is erroneous.
We would rather say it is short-lived in bad soil:
Memel fir (Pinus sylvestris), is of very superior quality,
very large growthed, and of great age. He also
asserts “elm prefers a strong clay soil, and it is perhaps
impossible to bring this tree to the utmost size
it is capable of attaining in land of a different quality.”
This is also erroneous. We have seen very
beautiful large Scots elms grubbed out from a soil
of pure gravel, and we can show thousands of instances
where Scots elms do not thrive well in clay—in rich
as well as poor clay. We are aware that in every volume
treating of numerous facts, such as Mr Cruickshank’s,
many inaccuracies may always be picked out,
but the above are rather too prominent.</p>

<p>Mr Cruickshank censures the practice of covering
fir seeds one-half inch deep in England,
referring the <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
demand there for Scots plants to the seeds being thus
buried in place of being sown, and states that they
should only be covered one-fourth of an inch, as is the
practice in Aberdeenshire. He also reprehends the
author of the Encyclopædia of Gardening, on account
of some directions which this author has given, to
form, by forcing, a fine friable soil, suitable for the
delicate seeds of trees, where this does not previously
exist. Now, we should consider that the difference of
climate between the neighbourhood of London and
Aberdeen would require a difference of cover nearly
equal to this; and that forcing a friable earth for
seed-beds was absolutely necessary, in the very adhesive
clays around London, and so general in the
more recent formations of the south and middle of
England, although superfluous in the north of Scotland,
where sandy or light soil is sufficiently abundant.
Seeds, under a moist cloudy atmosphere, will
vegetate without cover at all; but in situations where
the air is arid in spring, with much sunshine, a covering
of some depth is necessary, and that covering,
where the rudiments of the plant spring out weak
and delicate, is required to be soft and friable, a good
absorber and retainer of moisture, and not disposed
to run together with rain, or crack with drought.</p>

<p>Mr Cruickshank gives an account
of our different <span class="xxpn" id="p331">{331}</span>
forest trees, neither very accurate nor interesting,
but, luckily, not very tedious. He then proceeds to
treat of nursery, sowing, transplanting, and choosing
of plants, where many sensible, though some of them
common-place, observations occur, of much use to the
generality of planters. His views, however, of the proper
manner of planting seedlings in the nursery, are
defective. The best method of planting these—neither
by laying, nor by dibbling—is first to stretch the
line and make a furrow, level in the bottom, as broad
as the roots may stretch, with the inner side straight
and steep. One person then holds the plant erect
in its berth, from two to four inches from the perpendicular
side, according to the general size of the horizontal
roots, so that the fibres may be regularly
spread; and another person throws on the earth from
the place of the next furrow; the placer of the plants
footing the earth to the roots as he proceeds, or after
the row is completed.</p>

<p>The following observations of Mr Cruickshank
are worthy the attention of planters:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Proprietors should not attempt to raise seedlings,
but purchase them from professional nurserymen,
and place them in a succession nursery of their own.
A proprietor may, in general, purchase seedlings
much cheaper than he can raise them;
while the case <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
is just the reverse with regard to plants of a greater
age. In raising seedlings, much skill and attention
is requisite, which the professional man can always
command at a much more reasonable rate than the
proprietor. In the treatment of plants after they
are removed from the seed-bed, the rent of the ground
is the chief source of expense, as any common gardener
will be able to manage them.”</p>

<p>“A general, and a very gross error, in purchasing
plants, is to consider those as best which are the
largest in proportion to their age. This absurd principle
of selection makes those nurseries most frequented
by customers which least deserve to be so,
such, namely, as are situated in the richest soils, surrounded
by the closest shelter, and stimulated by the
greatest quantities of manure. It is necessary, no
doubt, that plants should be of a size to suit them to
the situations for which they are intended; but if
they have attained this size sooner than the due
time by being forced, they are in the worst state imaginable
for growing in a barren moor, or on the
bleak side of a mountain.”</p>

<p>“Plants are often much injured, though raised
sufficiently hardy in other respects, by being too
much crowded in the nursery line.”—“The surest
method that I know of enabling those
who have little <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
experience, to ascertain whether plants, in the seed-bed,
are too much crowded or not, is to compare such
as grow on the verge of the alley with those in the
interior. If the girt of the latter be equal, or nearly
so, to that of the former, the plants have sufficient
room.”—“When plants have stood for several years
in nursery lines, if they are too much crowded, many
of their lower branches will be sickly or withered, or
the stems will be entirely devoid of branches, excepting
within a few inches of the top. This is a
mark so plain that no one can mistake.</p>

<p>“Care should be taken not to purchase plants
which betray symptoms of disease. When larches
not more than three years old cast the whole, or
even the greater part, of their leaves, just when the
winter commences, it is a sure sign that they are in
an unhealthy state, and that many of them will die
in the course of next season; for, under this age, the
larch should retain a considerable quantity of its old
leaves till spring.”—“There is also a minute white
insect, which is fatal to the larch in plantations, that
sometimes attacks it in the nursery after it enters
its second year; on this account, it is proper to examine
the larch plants the summer previous to purchasing
them.”—“Scots fir maybe regarded as sickly,
when the points of the leaves
become withered, or <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
when they change their naturally dark colours into
a faint yellowish green. Any vestige of withering
on the spruce or silver fir, is a sure prognostication
of approaching decay. Any kind of fir which has
lost its leader may be considered useless.</p>

<p>“When plants are packed up in mats for the conveniency
of carriage, strict orders should be given
that those which carry their leaves in winter be
taken up when they are entirely free from moisture.
If they be pulled wet, they will heat and get mouldy
in the packages. In the course of a few days good
plants are often spoiled in this manner.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Cruickshank does not swerve from the common
foolish system, of inculcating a determinate
character of soil as generally necessary for each kind
of tree. We are angry with the dulness of the writers
on location of timber; they will not comprehend
that a tree has two ends, by both of which it draws
moisture, though from different elements, earth and
air. The dullest clown is sensible he requires to
drink more under an arid sun than under a drizzling
rain. The same holds of trees; if there be little
evaporation of moisture from the leaves, and if the
leaves, instead of exhaling, can frequently even imbibe
water, from the plant occupying an elevated situation,
where the air the greater part
of the season <span class="xxpn" id="p335">{335}</span>
is cool, and nearly surcharged with moisture, the
most porous, driest soil (sufficiently damp in such a
situation), will generally be the most suitable; and
trees of every kind will prosper in sands, in which,
under a dry atmosphere, they would not have survived
one summer; whereas in arid, warm, low
country, the deepest, dampest loams and clays are
generally the best suited for timber, provided water
does not stagnate. And, besides, we have found varieties
of the same kind or species of tree, <i>some of
them adapted to prosper in dry air and soil, and
others in moist air and soil</i>. Although the above
causes prevent a positive limitation of certain kinds
of trees to certain soils, yet there are some which
have superior adaptation to moist soils and others to
dry; some whose roots, from their fibrous soft character,
can only spread luxuriantly on light, soft, or
mossy soils, and others, whose roots have power to
permeate the stiffest and most obdurate. The above
explanations will account for much of the incongruity
which we find in authors regarding the adaptation
of certain kinds of timber to certain soils.</p>

<p>In describing the soils suitable for different
kinds of trees, Mr Cruickshank mentions, that
“the Scots fir will thrive in very barren situations,
provided the soil be dry. Dryness is,
in fact, the <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
most indispensable requisite in order to produce a
good crop of Scots fir, and it is never advisable to
plant this tree in very moist ground, or where draining
is necessary to carry off the surface water.”—“Stiff
land seems decidedly hostile to its growth.”—“On
a deep rich soil it grows very fast, attains a
large size, and soon decays. In these circumstances,
its wood is spongy, and of inferior value.”—“The
most important precept that can be delivered with
regard to this tree, is never to plant it either in <i>wet</i>
or <i>very stiff</i> land.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The larch is also a very hardy plant, and is sure
to thrive on any land that will answer for the Scots
fir. It is, however, less delicate in its choice of soil
than the latter, and will grow in a much greater
degree of moisture.”—“This tree is one of the surest
growers we have in barren soils.”</p>

<p>“The spruce is as partial to moist land as the
Scots fir is to dry; and in this particular these two
species stand directly opposed to one another.”—“Spruce
may indeed appear to thrive in a dry situation
for a few years; but by the time it reaches ten
or twelve feet in height, its lower branches will decay,
and after that period it will make little progress,
but remain even a cumberer of the soil.”—“ Spruce
seems to be most partial to a cold stiff
clay: it is, <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
however, a very hardy plant, and not very nice in its
choice of soil, provided it have enough of sap.”—“I
do not mean such as is deluged in winter with stagnant
water. This is incompatible with the growth
of wood of every kind.”—“The silver fir and balm
of Gilead will answer in the same kinds of land as
the spruce.”—“They, together with the spruce, are
invaluable for where the soil is deep peat-moss, as
neither the Scots fir nor the larch will thrive
in it.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="padtopc">There
is in the above quotations, in common with
many of our opinions (formed hastily upon a too
partial acquaintance with facts), a considerable proportion
both of truth and error. Such sweeping assertions
will, however, generally command the assent
and admiration of the reader. From the enjoyment
the mind has in forming clear conceptions and reaching
conclusions, from its love of order, and from
its disposition to cling to every thing like definite,
unfluctuating arrangement, to assist its limited powers
of comprehension, we are led away by the author, who
reduces the character of natural phenomena to great
simplicity, although in reality exceedingly complicated.</p>

<p>Scots fir, it is true, has rather a superior adaptation
to dry, sharp, and rocky soils; yet
there are many <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span>
situations of poor wet till and clay, and even peat-moss
ground, where it will be advantageous to plant
Scots fir in preference to any other kind of timber;
for this plain reason, that no other kind will thrive
so well in those cold moist moors. Both Larix and
Abies have a much narrower range of adaptation than
Pinus sylvestris. Larch will not thrive in the dead
sand nor till flats of the low country, often not in
the dead sand and till of rising grounds, in both of
which the Scots fir, if allowed sufficient room for
side branching, will reach good-sized timber. There
is a considerable formation of peat-moss near Dunmore,
in which the Scots fir has shown superior adaptation
to the Norway spruce. We have also seen,
in the moss of Balgowan, Perthshire, fine thriving
Scots firs, many of them two feet in diameter, growing
in very moist, rich, mossy loam,—so moist, that
although in a rather protected situation, a number
of the trees, while young, had been laid on their sides
by the wind, and were growing luxuriantly in the
form of a quadrant of a circle, with as much as six
and eight feet of the stem upon the level ground,
affording a curve sufficient to reach from the keel of
a vessel to the deck at midships. We examined the
timber of several of these, and found it superior to
the average of home P. sylvestris.
The superior <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span>
quality of the timber may be ascribed to the richness and
moisture of the soil, and to the full branching of
the trees from their rather open arrangement. There
is nothing which conduces so much to the good quality
of Scots fir as exposure. Under the great shelter
of the close <i>planted</i> woods, the timber is soft and
porous, without much resin; but under great exposure,
especially to dry air, the timber is hard, close,
and resinous. This is, however, considerably modified
by the soil.</p>

<p>The quality of natural grown timber is considered
superior to the planted. Is this occasioned by the
former having generally more branches and leaves in
proportion to the length of the stem, and being more
exposed than the latter? Can root fracture at transplanting,
or the kiln-drying of the cones, have any
influence to diminish the strength of the fibre or
quantity of resinous deposit? We have been told
by several old people, in the neighbourhood of
Dunsinane, that Scots fir plants, brought more than
half a century ago from Mar Forest to Dunsinane
Wood, succeeded much better than some which had
been procured from nurseries, and also produced better
timber.</p>

<p>Clay is assuredly <i>not</i> the proper soil for spruce
and silver fir; their exceedingly numerous, soft, fibrous,
moss-like rootlets, require an
easy damp soil. <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span>
We have tried a number of kinds of abies, in both
dry and moist clay, and have found they did not
grow so luxuriantly (thrive so well) as Scots fir or
larch. The silver fir shewed superior adaptation to
any of the other kinds of abies.</p>

<p>Almost in every instance where we have seen the
silver fir and Norway spruce (by far the best spruce
for Scotland) growing together, the former was the
superior. The timber, in the lower part of the stem,
is harder than that of the spruce, but freer and more
porous in the upper part. It is probable that the
silver fir will not thrive in so elevated or so moist a
situation as the spruce, but in all favourable soils it
merits a preference.</p>

<p>We now come to a very important part of our
author’s volume—an account of the most economical,
and, as he says, the most successful, mode of
planting moors and bleak exposed mountains, but
which is brought forward by him under no limitation
to place. To the invention of this method, our
author lays no claim; he merely describes the practice
in a clear and judicious manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The most proper time for removing firs from
the nursery to waste land, is when they are two
years old.”—“The experience I have had enables
me to say, with as much confidence as I
can speak on <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
any point whatever, that the longer any fir is allowed
to remain in the nursery after it has attained
two years’ growth, so much the less chance is there
of its success when removed to its final destination.”—“At
this period (two years’ growth) larches may
be obtained transplanted, as it is customary to
put considerable numbers of them out into nursery-lines
when they are one year old. Such plants have
better roots than those that have remained in the
seed-bed till they are of the same age; but as their
price is considerably higher than that of the latter,
it is somewhat doubtful whether they are so much
superior in quality as to compensate for the greater
expense. At all events, healthy larches from the
seed-bed have never failed to give satisfaction when
properly planted in soil suitable for them. Other
species of fir are scarce ever transplanted in the nursery
till they are two years old, so of this age there
is no choice left but to take them from the seed-bed.”—“Birch,
alder, and mountain ash, succeed
well when removed from the nursery in their second
year.”—“Beech and plane do not succeed well unless
they have stood some time (two years at least)
in nursery lines, after having been removed from the
seed-bed.”</p>

<p>“The pitting system of planting
should be <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
adopted in every instance in which the plants exceed two
years old.</p>

<p>“The expense of planting was much reduced by
the introduction, about a century ago, of the notching
system. Of this there are two varieties, the
oldest of which may be described as follows:—One
person makes a notch in the ground, or rather two
notches crossing each other, with a common spade,
raising the sod by bending down the handle of the
instrument, till the notch become wide enough to
receive the roots of the plant. An assistant, with
a bundle of trees, slips the root of one into the aperture
thus made for its reception. The spade is then
withdrawn, and the closing of the sod on the root is
assisted by a smart blow of the heel of the planter.
In this way two persons, well practised in the work,
will put into the ground between five hundred and
a thousand per day.</p>

<p>“This system was much simplified about fifty
years ago, and rendered so expeditious, that it seems
in vain to look for its receiving any further improvement.
Instead of the spade, an instrument of nearly
the same shape, but so small that it can be wrought
with one hand as easily as a common garden-dibble,
was introduced, and is now known by the name of
the Planting-iron. With this, a notch
is made in <span class="xxpn" id="p343">{343}</span>
the ground to receive the root; and owing to the
portability of the tool, and its occupying but one of
the hands, the person that works it requires no assistant,
but, carrying a parcel of plants in a wallet
before him, he singles out one with his left hand,
inserts it in the notch, withdraws the implement,
fixes the plant with his heel, and proceeds with as
much apparent ease as if he were performing the
operation in the soft ground of the nursery. In this
way of planting, the workman goes forward in such
a line as he can judge of by his eye; and as it is
extremely difficult to see the plants after they are
put in, especially if the heath is pretty long, he sets
up poles in the first line, to enable him to keep the
second a due distance from it; and in planting the
last mentioned, he removes these poles into it as he
comes opposite to them, which then serve as his
guide in planting the third; and thus he proceeds
till he cover the whole ground. The lines thus
formed are necessarily so zig-zag, that when the
trees grow up, they do not seem to have been planted
in rows.</p>

<p>“In this way, an expert workman will plant between
three and four thousand young plants a-day,
and do it so perfectly, that the fault will not be his
if a single individual of the whole
number fail to <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
grow. I have assisted in planting, according to this
plan, upwards of three thousand acres in Aberdeenshire;
and, in all that extent, I know not of a single
instance of failure, where the plants were in a
healthy state when put into the ground, of the proper
age and varieties, and suitable for the soil.”</p>

<p>“To plant well and expeditiously in this way,
requires considerable dexterity on the part of the
workman; and where raw hands are employed, it
will be necessary to have some person to teach and
superintend them.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="padtopc">Mr Cruickshank
disposes of the old cross system
of slit planting by the spade, with very little ceremony;
as it would almost seem, without being able
to appreciate its merits. It is, in fact, a totally different
mode of planting from that by the flat dibble-planter
or planting-iron, and is well adapted for
all plants with horizontal roots, and which have stood
from one to three years in the nursery line. By
first striking the spade in perpendicularly, as deep
as the turf-soil, by again striking it in at right
angles to the end of the first cut, in the form of
a T, and bending back the spade, the turf-soil
is raised from a horizontal bed, and the first cut
opened so wide as to admit the
root, which <span class="xxpn" id="p345">{345}</span>
inserted and drawn a little along by an experienced
hand, and well tramped down, has its rootlets disposed
over the horizontal bottom almost as regularly
and well adjusted for growing, as can be done by
pit-planting. This practice is sometimes performed
singly, a clever workman managing the spade with
one hand and the plants with the other, and inserting
1000 each day. The plants suited for this system
are fully double the size of those suited for the
flat-dibble system, and are purchased at about one
half more price, thus enhancing the cost of planting
to £1, 10s. or £2 per acre; but in many situations,
especially where the herbage grows freely,
affording an earlier growth, and more regular success,
sufficient to balance the greater expense ten
times over.</p>

<p>Although the cross-system of slitting is the best
for commanding general success, yet wherever the
flat dibble planting can be depended on, it merits a
preference, as from the smallness of the plants, the
roots receive less fracture and derangement in the
woody state, and the process comes nearer to raising
from the seed <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>The expense of each system per acre, will be nearly
as follows:— <span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span></p>

<p>Although our author speaks so confidently of the
success of transplanting out firs at one and two years
of age, yet this must only be taken under limitation
to the country in which his experience has lain,—the
barren mountains and moors of Scotland, where
the vegetation of the heaths is extremely slow, and
the herbage both thin and short. Were these small
plants used in the superior climates of England and
Ireland, where the vegetation of
the grasses, and <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
other natural occupiers of the soil, is very luxuriant,
there would scarcely be one in a hundred that would
ever be seen after the first spring, unless a very expensive
cultivation to check the weeds were resorted
to. To effect economical planting in these soils, it
is necessary to have the plants sufficiently large, not
too close together, and placed in rows, that a mower
may be able to distinguish them among the herbage
while he cuts it down; or what is much better,
that the spade or plough<a class="afnanc" href="#fn65" id="fnm65">65</a>
culture may be <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
practised, and potatoes, turnips, or other green crop,
raised among them, without the plants being overwhelmed.
In case of grass production, the oftener
during the season the young plantation is mown,
the more advantageous, as well that the plants may
be the more easily distinguished, as that the lower
branches may not be smothered, nor the soil so much
exhausted and dried by the blooming and seeding
of the herbage; of course, a short scythe is required,
and also a very careful mower.</p>

<p>Speaking of the best season for planting, Mr
Cruickshank states:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In wet and swampy soils, as well as in land,
whether dry or moist, whose surface is bare, I would
be inclined to prefer the spring. Wet land swells
to such a degree, that plants which have not had
time to take a firm hold with their roots, are almost <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span>
inevitably thrown out.”—“These remarks have reference
only to the system of planting by notching:
when the pitting system is adopted, it fixes the plant
so thoroughly, as to render the utmost power of frost
incapable of doing them any injury.”—“The utmost
limits of the planting season may be estimated from
the middle of October to the middle of March.”—“I
am a decided advocate for thick planting, and
would advise that no fewer than 3000 trees per acre
be planted in good land, nor a less number than
4000 when the soil is of a middling or inferior quality.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Cruickshank must surely have had little acquaintance
with soft, spongy, close-bottomed soils,
or he would not have asserted that pit-planted trees
are not subject to be thrown. If planted in the early
part of winter or autumn, trees of the usual size,
which have remained from one to three years in the
nursery line, are very frequently thrown from such
soils. This is caused by the freezing earth first
catching fast hold of the plant at the surface, and
afterwards swelling underneath from the enlargement
of the freezing water in its pores, and from
the open crystallized <i>honeycomb</i> arrangement which
takes place by congelation. As the stem
is fast to <span class="xxpn" id="p350">{350}</span>
the ground at the surface, and the earth subsequently
enlarged underneath as far as the congelation
proceeds, the roots below the congelation must
of necessity be drawn upwards to the distance which
the ground has swelled after the stem was fixed to
the surface. The earth, on thaw, first loses hold of
the plant at the surface, and then falls away as it
contracts. Each successive frost and thaw during
winter thus raises the plant a certain space, till by
spring it often is so far extracted, as to fall over on
its side. When the plant has stood a season, there
is generally a tuft of herbage around its stem, which
prevents the freezing in a considerable degree; and
the roots having fixed in the lower earth, resist the
pulling up so much, that the hold which the frozen
earth has of the stem at the surface gives way,
sometimes pulling off a portion of the bark, and the
earth rises around the stem in place of pulling the
tree.</p>

<p>Instead of the season for spring planting being
over by the middle of March, we think that, in
many of our wet moors, it should then only be commencing,
especially under the pitting system. However,
planting should never be deferred a day later
in spring than what is absolutely necessary to render
the ground sufficiently dry
for the process. <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span></p>

<p>Mr Cruickshank’s opinions regarding pruning and
thinning are generally not very incorrect. His commencing
sentence on pruning, that “most deciduous
trees, if left to themselves, have a tendency to
grow with short trunks, containing little timber,
and to waste their strength on large unwieldy tops,”
would, however, lead us to form a different conclusion.
The very tall, clean, straight, deciduous trees,
in the American forests, give a sufficient answer to
this. We like his remark respecting thinning, that
“it is only efficacious when applied as a preventive,
not as a cure.”</p>

<p>Mr Cruickshank next brings forward his plan of
raising oak forest, which appears to have been his
own invention, although invented before. Whenever
mice and other gnawers (glires) are not very
abundant, it, if properly executed, would seem to be
the best method of raising oak forest; and, indeed,
in many situations, the only practicable one. Mr
Cruickshank’s method coincides nearly with Mr
Sang’s, only he does not carry his system of protection
so far as Mr Sang, in first raising belts of
the most hardy kinds of timber, distributed to
windward of, and intersecting the place intended to
be planted, in such a manner as to afford the best
possible shelter from the
coldest most destructive <span class="xxpn" id="p352">{352}</span>
winds. Mr Cruickshank, who has never carried his
plan into execution, except in an experiment embracing
a few yards, directs that the ground intended
for oak forest should first be planted with
Scots fir and larch, about 4000 to the acre, by the
single-notch process, previously described, which
can be accomplished under L. 1 per acre. As soon
as these have risen to four feet in height, he prepares
patches about two feet square and ten feet
distant in the interstices, by digging the soil over,
and mixing a spadeful of slaked lime carefully with
the mould, taking out a tree whenever the interstices
do not suit for the patches. He then plants,
in the end of March or beginning of April, five
acorns in each patch, about an inch deep, one in the
centre, and the other four in the angles of a foot
square, and gives them no farther attention for two
years, except removing any overhanging low fir
branch. He then goes over the patches, cutting
out all the supernumerary plants, a few inches below
the surface, leaving the most promising one on
each patch, being very careful not to disturb any of
its roots in cutting out the others. As these oak
plants extend in size, he gradually removes the fir.</p>

<p>Excepting the bare plan itself, which is certainly
very plausible, there is nothing
in the description <span class="xxpn" id="p353">{353}</span>
of the practice—the preparation of the patches of
ground to receive the seed and the subsequent
management—which merits attention. His very
particular interdiction of the use of manure is, to
say the least of it, injudicious—as if it signified
to the plant whether it were forced by the use of
lime, or by a little putrescent manure, both of which
Mr Withers would consider very advantageous; or
as if there were much fear on our poor exposed
wastes of erring on the side of rendering the plant
delicate from over luxuriance; its constitution, on
the contrary, would rather be strengthened. Mr
Cruickshank, in directing the removal of the fir
nurses, one thousand per acre to stand till they have
reached twenty-five years, fit for roofing of cottages,
and similar purposes; and five hundred till they
have reached thirty-five years; his dividing a slaked
boll of lime into five hundred spadefuls; and his bestowing
no hoeing or weeding upon his seedlings,
would show, without his admitting it, that he had
never practised this mode of forming plantation.</p>

<p>Prefacing this system of rearing oak forest, Mr
Cruickshank in rather a clever manner points out its
advantages, and also the disadvantages and consequent
failures of <i>planting</i> young oak trees in exposed
situations. But after all his eulogy, we
think he has <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span>
left something unsaid. The great disadvantage attending
transplanting oaks to situations not very favourable
to their growth, is, that the plant which, under
any circumstances, receives irreparable and often
mortal harm, from the severe injuries of removal, has
to contend, in this mutilated condition, at the same
time with the uninjured occupiers of the soil (the
nurses or the native weeds), and with the unpropitious
situation; whereas, when the plant springs up from
the acorn a native, especially when it is assisted at
first by weeding or hoeing, the part above ground
being always in proportion to that below, and receiving
due nourishment, it contends with the occupiers
on more equal terms, and encounters the sterility
of the soil, or the severity of the climate, with
all its natural powers unimpaired.</p>

<p>As it is the natural condition of the seedling to
grow up under the shelter of the parent tree, so also
does it happen, that it rises under this shelter with
greater luxuriance and vigour than when exposed to
the evaporation, and parching sun, and battering
wind, of the bare country.</p>

<p>We have admired the beautiful, straight, luxuriant,
shoots of the young hollies, thrown out under shelter,
and have compared them with the dry stunted
shoots of the young holly in the open country,
though in the former case their roots
had to contend <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span>
with the roots of larger trees, and in the latter they
had the soil to themselves. Experience has proved,
that in exposed bleak situations, shelter is necessary
to young plants. Transplanted oaks among the
roots of young trees, so large as to afford sufficient
shelter, very frequently do not succeed, at least without
the utmost care in the transplanting, and a considerable
deal of labour to prevent the roots of the
shelter trees from starving the transplanted ones,
unless a very propitious moist summer follow the
transplanting. Raising from the seed, which obviates
all this, seems therefore the only conveniently
practicable way. Yet it must be owned, that
the system of raising forests <i>in situ</i> from the seed,
appears, as yet, much more successful on paper than
on our hills and moors.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to confute the opinion, that the
oak will not grow throughout Scotland, but in the
milder and more propitious situations, Mr Cruickshank
adduces the well-known fact, that large oak
timber is found in almost every peat-moss.</p>

<p>This is a fact worth tracing to its cause. Under
Nature’s own conduct, trees advance considerably further
into elevated or cold inhospitable regions, than
they would otherwise do, by means of the mutual
shelter, and of the more hardy kinds acting as an advance
guard. Yet there is a limit to
this, as the <span class="xxpn" id="p356">{356}</span>
power of ripening seed is not increased by shelter in
proportion to the power of growing—perhaps not
at all; we instance the Spanish chestnut, which
has scarcely ever been known to ripen seed in Scotland.
Seed-grown trees will, therefore, under Nature’s
arrangement, not be found extending much
beyond <i>the line of seed ripening</i>. From nuts,
acorns, and other seeds, fully developed, being found
in elevated mosses in this country, other causes than
shelter appear to have existed.</p>

<p>Before this country was so much overrun by men
and oxen, a great deal of timber had existed, covering
much of the superior land which is now under
tillage. This consisted chiefly of the oak, Scots fir,
birch, hazel, and alder,—the oak extending northward
and to elevations, and ripening seed, and attaining
to a size which it does not now do, either
wild or cultivated, in the same latitude, neither here
nor in any other portion of the world; which, along
with some other facts, lead to the supposition, that
the climate has changed a little,—in part, possibly,
as we have before stated, from the gradual formation
of peat, to which, overthrown oak forest, from the
abundance of the tannin principle, has a great disposing
influence, even under a warmer climate than
present Scotland. The highest latitude to which a
tree, or any other kind of plant,
reproducing by seed, <span class="xxpn" id="p357">{357}</span>
naturally extends, depending on the ripening of the
seed, and also on the power of occupancy, is however
different from that where it will grow, when
ripe seeds are procured from the coldest place where
they ripen, and all the competitors removed; and
under the system of shelter belts, hardy pine nurses,
and seeds from the nearest place where they ripen,
we have no doubt that oaks may be extended to a
colder situation than Nature herself would have
placed them in. For the higher more bleak portion
of the country, we would recommend acorns
grown in Scotland, in preference to those imported
from England. We have several times observed
wheat, the seed of which had been imported from
England, sustain blight and other injuries in a cold
moist autumn, when a portion of the same field,
sown of Scots seed, at the same time as the other,
and under the very same circumstances, was entirely
free from injury. English acorns are also frequently
heated in the casks in which they are imported,
which must impair their vigour<a class="afnanc" href="#fn66" id="fnm66">66</a>. <span class="xxpn" id="p358">{358}</span></p>

<p>The part of Mr Cruickshank’s volume which we
have analyzed, does not extend much beyond the
first half: this portion is well worth a perusal. We
have merely glanced over the remainder: it is a
make-up scarce worth noticing. The language, on
the whole, is easy and plain; and although the volume
contains a considerable number of errors, in
the pointing out of which we have not been sparing,
yet will it form an excellent planter’s assistant to
people who have ground to plant, and are ignorant
of the process of planting.</p>

<hr class="hr34" />

<p>We have now brought before the reader a pretty
fair picture of the Forestry of the present day.
Some may wonder that the written science of arboriculture
should be so imperfect and inaccurate;
but the knowledge of the art, and the power of communicating
that knowledge, are of
so different a <span class="xxpn" id="p359">{359}</span>
character, it not unfrequently happens, that those write
who cannot act, and those who can, are incompetent
to write—sometimes unwilling; besides, correct
opinions on this subject, as on most others, are
only just beginning to be formed. We have endeavoured
to assist in disentangling the correct from the
erroneous. It is impossible for the most wary always
to avoid misconception of facts, but man merits
the name of rational only, when he evinces a readiness
to break from those misconceptions, to which
the narrow-minded, the proud, the vain, and the
creature of habit and instinct, cling so obstinately.
As a friend, we have stood on no ceremony with our
brother arboriculturists. We have laid ourselves
open to their criticism, and we hope they will shew
as little ceremony with us.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO PART IV.</h3>
<ul>
<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm36" id="fn36">36</a>.
This repetition of our directions on pruning is intentional—“Carthago
est delenda.”</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm37" id="fn37">37</a>.
The coniferæ have a weaker or more connected vitality than
most other trees—the whole individual participating in the injury
of any part. Perhaps this arises from the liability of resinous
juice to putrescency—any putrid affection in one spot of the more
vital part of the tree spreading quickly
over the whole.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm38" id="fn38">38</a>.
Transplanting having an opposite influence on the young
of herbaceous and woody vegetables, in the former when
not already rising into stem, retarding, and the latter
accelerating or furthering development of the reproductory
parts, is a good lesson to reasoners from analogy. The
root-fractured herbaceous plants repairing the injury almost
immediately, and before the rudiments of the reproductory
parts have time for expansion, the greater quantity of
moist nourishment afforded by the unsought newly stirred
soil, produces a flush of radical leaves, which react to
further the extension of the roots. The new rootlets have
again more connexion to promote the growth of the radical
leaves, and to induce offsets—<i>tillering</i>—from the sides
of the bulb, than to nourish or mature the core part, from
whence the stem arises—a certain comparative extension and
maturity of the core being necessary to the rising of the
stem. Thence seeding can be retarded, and life in annuals be
continued, <i>ad libitum</i>. On the contrary, in woody vegetables
of perennial stem, the reparation of the root-injury takes
place slowly, and the evaporation from the stem and elevated
branches and leaves exhausting the little moisture afforded
by the inadequate root-suction during an entire season, gives
time and bias for the germs to pass into reproductory instead
of productory organs even the first season.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm39" id="fn39">39</a>.
We rather think Mr Sang mentions this.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm40" id="fn40">40</a>.
They say a better management has lately been established.
This may be followed for a short time in the high stream of the
agitation, or while the present heads of management remain in
power; but the system, we fear, contains the seeds of evil, which,
like the weeds, will soon overwhelm
the alien good.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm41" id="fn41">41</a>.
The inferior growth of the part of a hedge which was pruned
before the vegetation had begun, may be ascribed to the vital action
having been checked at the commencement by the destruction
of the buds necessary to stimulate this action; and being deprived
of this first strong impulse, life had remained languid
throughout the season, the roots never recovering their proper
suction or foraging power;—when the pruning was later, a sufficient
stimulus had already been given.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm42" id="fn42">42</a>.
Vide Sir Walter Scott.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm43" id="fn43">43</a>.
The want of the annual layers of cellular tissue of wood,
exterior to and separating the annual lineal tubes, is so complete
in some cases of slow growth, that the timber seems only a
light congeries of tubes, without arrangement; hence the age of
the tree cannot be determined but by a section of the root-bulb,
where the growths are larger, and
the deposits regular.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm44" id="fn44">44</a>. The climate of a country in regard to annual
steadiness, can be pretty accurately determined by the
appearance of the annual layers of trees, especially of the
pine tribe; and in a new settlement where great difference of
size of layer, and of resinous deposit is observed, we may
be pretty certain the seasons are not steady, or that insect
depredations or blights occur; and a reserve of food ought
always to be retained. By careful inspection of the nature
of the annual wood deposit, or of the locality with regard
to moisture, it may be ascertained, whether the irregularity
has been owing to difference of temperature, or of moisture.
In warm climates the irregularity will generally depend
on drought and moisture, and in cold climates on heat and
cold; though sometimes the depredations of insects, such as
locusts, or of blights, may be the cause.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm45" id="fn45">45</a>.
Though we give this experiment, we admit that little dependence
can be placed upon a single fact. The trees must have
been different in variety, and probably in sex, both of which may
occasion a discrepancy.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm46" id="fn46">46</a>.
The time the weight is in suspension, must be attended to. A
beam will support a much greater weight during a minute than
during an hour; and two beams may be found, the one capable
of supporting the greatest weight during a minute, and the
other the greatest during an hour.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm47" id="fn47">47</a>.
We shall not here introduce the interminable discussion of
dry-rot, as it remains to be proved that moderately fast grown
young timber is at all more liable to dry-rot than small-growthed
old, provided the sap-wood be entirely removed.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm48" id="fn48">48</a>.
In fairness, it may be proper to explain, that the greater
part of the trees we have thus cultivated have been of
<i>Pyrus</i>, although we commenced the practice with common
forest trees—yet the pear and apple vary nothing from the
oak and ash in the primary stage of life, in as far as
respects the extension—we can also profit fully as much by
raising apple timber of proper fast grown variety, as by any
other timber; and have it in our power to sell this timber to
machine-makers at double the price of oak of the same size.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm49" id="fn49">49</a>.
We think Sir Henry would find some of the failures of which
he owns he cannot well ascertain the cause, but occurring especially
in beech and oak, to be owing to a number of the lower
roots, which are by far the tenderest, being bruised by the weight
of the tree itself, when he turns it repeatedly over from the one
side to the other, in order, by throwing in earth beneath it, to
raise the root on a level with the surface of the field, the whole
weight of the incumbent mass resting upon these soft roots. The
oak, and still more the beech, are exceedingly susceptible to injury
from cutting or bruises, and die far inward from the laceration.
The wounded lower roots, especially when any vacuity is
left not filled close in with earth, where mouldiness might generate
in a dry situation, or when soaking in moisture for a part of
the season, will become corrupted; the putrefaction thence gradually
extending upward into the bulb, will contaminate the whole,
and the second or third year after planting, the tree
will be dead.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm50" id="fn50">50</a>.
We understand freezing the earth around the bulb is an old
practice.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm51" id="fn51">51</a>.
We particularize the oak, cork-tree of arid warm Spain, and
much of the timber of New Holland. Owing to the hot parching
air in the latter place, the epidermis becomes dried to such a
degree, that contracting by the drought, and bursting by the
swelling of the enveloped stem, it peels off like the old skin of a
serpent, and is often seen hanging upon the tree in large shreds
like tattered garments. In several kinds of trees, we have counted
regular annual rings of desiccated bark; in some kinds this appeared
a growth or deposition, in others, mere parched exuviæ.
Trees attain some age before the <i>exuviæ</i> commence; the <i>deposit</i>
begins the first season, even in sheltered situations. The cork-tree,
and the small-leaved elm, shew the greatest annual deposit of
dry bark. The former does, and the latter is said to belong to
warm arid countries; both form a better nonconductor of heat
than any other dry bark we are acquainted with—infinitely better
than the bark exuviæ of trees which approach
the polar regions.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm52" id="fn52">52</a>.
We do not pretend to explain how it is, that one kind of
climbing plant follows the sun in its convolutions, and another
traverses his course. There surely cannot be any thing in a habit
acquired in the southern hemisphere.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm53" id="fn53">53</a>.
In proceeding further on in Sir Henry’s volume, we have
noticed an excellent observation quoted from Du Hamel: “The
extension of the shoot is inversely as its induration, rapid while it
remains herbaceous, but slow as it is converted into wood. Hence
moisture and shade are the circumstances, of all others, the most
favourable to elongation, because they prevent induration or retard
it.” Although quoting this, Sir Henry recurs to his old opinions,
and proceeds to observe, “Trees so circumstanced, push
upward to the light; and from the warmth which their situation
affords, their stems being thin and slender in proportion to their
height, they are destitute of strength to
resist the winds.”</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm54" id="fn54">54</a>.
We do not mention temperature, because we are not in possession
of facts sufficient to lead us to form an opinion on the
subject. Judging from animal analogy, of which our author is so
fond, we notice, that those animals exposed in open atmosphere,
have generally warmer blood than those who lurk in holes,—even
than those of the same species who happen to live under shelter.
Now evaporation takes place from animals as well as from vegetables,
and the consequent cold is more than balanced by the heat of
what may be termed the vital fire, which, like most other fires,
burns brightest on exposure to a current of atmospheric air, being
increased either by the result of the new chemical combinations
having less capacity for heat, or by the stimulus of the fresh
moving air exciting the vital action. Of the general influence of
close forest on temperature, we are also not very well assured;
but the few facts which observation has afforded, lead to the
opinion, that to the northward of 50 deg. Lat. forests have higher
temperature than bare country; that from about 50 to 30 degrees
Lat. forests are cooler in winter and
warmer in summer;
and that nearer the equator, forests are generally cooler
than bare country. But the temperature is regulated so much
by the position of seas and lakes, in combination with the prevailing
currents and strength of currents of the air—by the configuration
of the country,—moisture and cloudiness of the atmosphere
and quantity of rain,—by the composition, arrangement, and colour
of the soil,—by the lower vegetable cover, and even by the
nature of the forest itself, whether deciduous or evergreen, that
particular facts must be very carefully weighed to enable us to
reach general conclusions. It is generally understood, that forests
render the climate moister.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm55" id="fn55">55</a>.
Our experiments have not yet been carried so far, as to determine
if, by any arrangement of drying or exposure, they may
be seasoned to sustain intense frost, which may affect them
differently from moderate frost, either by causing complete congelation
of all their structure (moderate freezing appearing only
to congeal their fluids, but not entirely the containing vessel, at
least only partly congealing the mass), or by killing the vital
principle itself through nervous affection. The potatoes became
green from the exposure to the light, and we rather think acquired
greater hardihood of constitution, or greater vitality or excitability
by the exposure, thence greater power to resist the cold,
independent of the disposition they acquired by desiccation to endure
it.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm56" id="fn56">56</a>.
Is the rending of the stems of trees, during intense frost, internal
only, and occasioned by the alburnum expanding more by
congelation than the drier mature wood? or, is it external, and
caused by the contractile effect of the dry air and cold on the alburnum
rendering it insufficient to surround the mature wood,
which, from dryness and want of living susceptibility, may not
contract so much.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm57" id="fn57">57</a>.
The fineness of vessel or fibre of the Siberian crab, may be
induced by the arid warm air, the continued radiation of heat and
light upon the portion above ground, and the coldness of the ground
around the roots during the short summer in Siberia, where the
air and surface of the ground is warm, and vegetation progressive,
while the ground remains frozen at a small depth. Like all varieties
of plants habituated to colder climate, the Siberian crab
developes its leaves under less heat than varieties of the same kind
which have been habituated to milder climate.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm58" id="fn58">58</a>.
We have not taken Sir Henry in the literal sense. Timber
is well known to decay sooner in a warm than in a cold country,
<i>cæteris paribus</i>.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm59" id="fn59">59</a>. See Appendix F.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm60" id="fn60">60</a>.
The preliminary sentence is very vaguely worded; we suppose,
“increasing the annual circles,” means increasing them in
thickness, not general contents of length multiplied by thickness.
But even in the latter sense, we hold pruning tends generally to
diminish the annual circles.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm61" id="fn61">61</a>.
It is a theory of Mr Sheriff, Mungo’s Wells, that all plants
have excrementitious deposit from the roots, the deposit from one
kind affording a good manure to another kind. Thence the advantage
of mixed grasses and legumes in pastures, and of the
rotation of different
kinds of crops.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm62" id="fn62">62</a>.
Vegetable soil is sometimes buried deep under volcanic mud,
sand, and ashes, or mixed with the subsoil by earthquakes. In some
districts of South America, the country, from being fertile, has
been recently reduced to sterility, by the vegetable mould being
so much scattered through the subsoil by repeated upheavings and
tossings about by earthquakes, as to be out of the
reach of plants.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm63" id="fn63">63</a>.
There is a deposition from the atmosphere of saline matter
going on at the surface of the earth, either evaporated from the
ocean, and falling with the rain and dews, or formed by gaseous
combinations—most probably both. In countries where the quantity
of rain is insufficient to wash this saline accumulation away
into the ocean as fast as it is formed, it increases to
such a degree
as almost to prevent vegetation, only a few of what are termed
saline plants appearing. This saline accumulation in warm dry
countries, bears considerable analogy to tannin deposit in cold
countries.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm64" id="fn64">64</a>.
The matured timber of the larch, in some cases, remains for
a considerable time stained before the rot proceeds rapidly; in
other cases, the rot makes quick progress; in this rapid decomposition,
certain kinds of fungi assist greatly. When once seated,
they seem to form a putrid atmosphere or tainted circle around
them, either by their living exhalations, or corrupt emanations when
dead, which is poisonous to the less vital parts of superior life, and
also expedites the commencement of decay in sound dead organic
matter, such as timber, thus furthering the decomposition so
far as to render it suitable food for their foul appetite, and paving
the way to their further progress.</p>

<p>How their seeds enter into the heart of a growing tree having
no external rottenness, is not very obvious, unless they are inhaled
or imbibed by the root tendrils: from the resemblance which
the growth of some of them has to fermentation, it is not even
very improbable that the animalcules of supposed molecular or
inferior life, have, of themselves, a disposition to unite into some
of these aggregates without the presence of any disposing germ.</p>

<p>The modifications of material attractions, by the varied germs of
superior life—the fixity of some of these deposites after life is gone—the
resolution of these into inferior animalcular,
or even molecular,
life—and the instrumentality of zoophytes of the lower order of
organization, in hastening this decomposition by the balancing of
the attractions of this secondary life, afford a wide field for investigation.
Those uncouth sportings of nature quickly appear and
disappear as <i>material</i> spectres, feeding on corruption, and mocking
at primary life.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm65" id="fn65">65</a>.
We have raised crops among young trees (as well timber as
fruit trees), not four yards apart, by plough culture, and have found
the process, after the ploughmen and horses were accustomed to it,
not much more expensive than common cultivation, and the crop,
till the trees became too close, scarcely inferior. By means of a
long <i>muzzle</i> to the plough standing out towards the left side, and
a driver to the horses beside the ploughman, we succeeded in getting
the two first furrows lapped a little over each other in the row
of trees, where the gathering of the ridge commenced (we gathered
up at every other row). In the row of trees where the finishing
of the ploughing of the ridge occurred, we were obliged to leave a
stripe of ground about two feet wide, to be dug by the spade. The
horses required to be yoked in file, and to drag by ropes (traces)
rather than by chains, as the bark of the trees was liable to be
rubbed off by the latter. The more to guard against rubbing, we
had the <i>swingletree</i> constructed so that the trace-ropes came out
from a hole in the ends, without any hook. In harrowing the
ground, one man is required to lead the horses, and another to direct
the harrows. In rich soil, under cultivation of green crop, in
this manner, trees progress very rapidly, and from the open arrangement
acquire very healthy constitutions.
Of course, when
not coniferæ, the plants require a little more attention to train to
one leader and equality of feeders, than when close planted. We
should consider plough cultivation of young woods, provided
ploughmen as expert and careful as the Scots could be obtained,
much more worthy the attention of the English planter than the
Withers’ system (trenching). Need we mention, that in green crop,
every thing depends upon plenty of manure and of well-timed
plough and horse hoe labour? Excepting in the case of larch, we
should dread no injury to the trees or timber from
plenty of manure.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm66" id="fn66">66</a>.
We are indebted to our friend Mr Gorrie, Annat Garden, for
the fact, that English acorns throw up a much more luxuriant
stem than the Scots; they forming a step of several inches
when planted next each other in the nursery line. We should
consider this to arise from the largeness of the rudiments of
the plant, and greater quantity of garnered nourishment in
the English acorns, which are nearly double the size of the
Scots, our present climate being insufficient for the proper
development. This leads to the question, will the greater
luxuriance balance any tenderness from want of acclimatizing?
Would the oak keep its present locality in Scotland if left
to nature? A careful inspection of the most elevated peat
mosses in which remains of timber exist, and a comparison of
the size of the seeds found there, with that of those of the
present day, grown the nearest to this in situation, would
resolve the question of refrigeration.</p></li></ul>

<p class="pfirst">It is only
on the <i>Ocean</i> that <i>Universal Empire</i> is
practicable—only by means of <i>Navigation</i> that all the world
can be subdued or retained under one dominion. On land, the
greatest numbers, and quantity of materiel, are unavailable,
excepting around the spot where they are produced. The most
powerful army is crippled by advancing a few degrees in
an enemy’s territory, unless when aided by some catching
enthusiasm; its resources get distant—communication is
obstructed—subjection does not extend beyond the range of
its guns, and it quickly melts away. The impossibility of
dominion extending over a great space, when communication
is only by land, has often been proved. The rule of Cyrus,
or Alexander, the Cæsars, the Tartar conquerors<a class="afnanc" href="#fn67" id="fnm67">67</a>, or
Bonaparte, did not extend over a tithe of the earth; and we
may believe, that, by some of these chiefs,
dominion was <span class="xxpn" id="p364">{364}</span>
extended as widely as under land communication could be
effected—further than under it could be supported.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when a powerful nation has her warlike
strength afloat, and possesses naval superiority, independent
of being unassailable herself, every spot of the
world, wherever a wave can roll, is accessible to her
power and under her control. In a very short time she
can throw an irresistible force, unexhausted by marches,
and with every resource, upon any hostile point, the point
of attack being in her own choice, and unknown to the
enemy. In case of her dependent dominions being scattered
over the two hemispheres, her means of communication,
and consequent power of defending these and
supporting authority, are more facile than what exists
between the seat of government of any ordinary sized
continental kingdom and its provinces. Were a popular
system of colonial government adopted, many islands
and inferior states would find it their interest to become
incorporated as part of the Empire.</p>

<p>There is a law universal in nature, tending to render
every reproductive being the best possibly suited to its
condition that its kind, or that organized matter, is susceptible
of, which appears intended to model the physical
and mental or instinctive powers, to their highest perfection,
and to continue them so. This law sustains the
lion in his strength, the hare in her
swiftness, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p365">{365}</span>
fox in his wiles. As Nature, in all her modifications of
life, has a power of increase far beyond what is needed to
supply the place of what falls by Time’s decay, those individuals
who possess not the requisite strength, swiftness,
hardihood, or cunning, fall prematurely without reproducing—either
a prey to their natural devourers, or
sinking under disease, generally induced by want of
nourishment, their place being occupied by the more perfect
of their own kind, who are pressing on the means of
subsistence. The law of entail, necessary to hereditary
nobility, is an outrage on this law of nature which she
will not pass unavenged—a law which has the most debasing
influence upon the energies of a people, and will
sooner or later lead to general subversion, more especially
when the executive of a country remains for a considerable
time efficient, and no effort is needed on the part
of the nobility to protect their own, or no war to draw
forth or preserve their powers by exertion. It is all
very well, when, in stormy times, the baron has every
faculty trained to its utmost ability in keeping his proud
crest aloft. How far hereditary nobility, under effective
government, has operated to retard “the march of intellect,”
and deteriorate the species in modern Europe, is
an interesting and important question. We have seen it
play its part in France; we see exhibition of its influence
throughout the Iberian peninsula, to the utmost degradation
of its victims. It has rendered the Italian peninsula,
with its islands, a blank in the political map of Europe.
Let the panegyrists of hereditary nobility, primogeniture,
and entail, say what these countries might
not have been <span class="xxpn" id="p366">{366}</span>
but for the baneful influence of this unnatural custom.
It is an eastern proverb, that no king is many removes
from a shepherd. Most conquerors and founders of dynasties
have followed the plough or the flock. Nobility,
to be in the highest perfection, like the finer varieties of
fruits, independent of having its vigour excited by regular
married alliance with wilder stocks, would require
stated complete renovation, by selection anew, from
among the purest crab. In some places, this renovation
would not be so soon requisite as in others, and, judging
from facts, we would instance Britain as perhaps the soil
where nobility will continue the longest untainted. As
we advance nearer to the equator, renovation becomes
sooner necessary, excepting at high elevation—in many
places, every third generation, at least with the Caucasian
breed, although the finest stocks be regularly imported.
This renovation is required as well physically
as morally.</p>

<p>It is chiefly in regard to the interval of time between
the period of necessary feudal authority, and that when
the body of the population having acquired the power of
self-government from the spread of knowledge, claim a
community of rights, that we have adverted to the use of
war. The manufacturer, the merchant, the sailor, the
capitalist, whose mind is not corrupted by the indolence
induced under the law of entail, are too much occupied
to require any stimulant beyond what the game in the
wide field of commercial adventure affords. A great
change in the circumstances of man is
obviously at hand. <span class="xxpn" id="p367">{367}</span>
In the first step beyond the condition of the wandering
savage, while the lower classes from ignorance remained
as helpless children, mankind naturally fell into clans
under paternal or feudal government; but as children,
when grown up to maturity, with the necessity for protection,
lose the subordination to parental authority, so
the great mass of the present population requiring no
guidance from a particular class of feudal lords, will not
continue to tolerate any hereditary claims of authority of
one portion of the population over their fellow-men; nor
any laws to keep up rank and wealth corresponding
to this exclusive power.—It would be <i>wisdom</i> in the
noblesse of Europe to abolish every claim or law which
serves to point them out a separate class, and, as quickly
as possible, to merge themselves into the mass of the population.
It is a law manifest in nature, that when the
use of any thing is past, its existence is no longer kept up.</p>

<p>Although the necessity for the existence of feudal lords
is past, yet the same does not hold in respect to a hereditary
head or King; and the stability of this head of the
government will, in no way, be lessened by such a change.
In the present state of European society, perhaps no other
rule can be so mild and efficient as that of a liberal benevolent
monarch, assisted by a popular representative
Parliament. The poorest man looks up to his king as his
own, with affection and pride, and considers him a protector;
while he only regards the antiquated feudal lord
with contempt. The influence of a respected hereditary
family, as head of a country, is also of
great utility in <span class="xxpn" id="p368">{368}</span>
forming a principle of union to the different members, and
in giving unity and stability to the government.</p>

<p>In respect to our own great landholders themselves, we
would ask, where is there that unnatural parent—that miserable
victim of hereditary pride—who does not desire to
see his domains equally divided among his own children?
The high paid sinecures in church and state will not
much longer be a great motive for keeping up a powerful
family head, whose influence may burthen their fellow-citizens
with the younger branches. Besides, when a
portion of land is so large, that the owner cannot have an
individual acquaintance and associations with every
stream, and bush, and rock, and knoll, the deep enjoyment
which the smaller native proprietor would have in
the peculiar features, is not called forth, and is lost to
man. The abolition of the law of entail and primogeniture,
will, in the present state of civilization, not only add
to the happiness of the proprietor, heighten morality, and
give much greater stability to the social order, but will
also give a general stimulus to industry and improvement,
increasing the comforts and elevating the condition of
the operative class.</p>

<p>In the new state of things which is near at hand, the
proprietor and the mercantile class will amalgamise,—employment
in useful occupations will not continue
to be held in scorn,—the merchant and manufacturer will
no longer be barely tolerated to exist, harassed at every
turn by imposts and the interference of petty tyrants;—Government,
instead of forming an engine of oppression,
being simplified and based on morality
and justice, will <span class="xxpn" id="p369">{369}</span>
become a cheap and efficient protection to person and
property; and the necessary taxation being levied from
property alone, every individual will purchase in the
cheapest market, and sell the produce of his industry in
the dearest. This period might, perhaps, be accelerated
throughout Europe, did the merchants and capitalists
only know their own strength. Let them, as citizens of
the world, hold annual congress in some central place,
and deliberate on the interests of man, which is their
own, and throw the whole of their influence to support
liberal and just governments, and to repress slavery,
crime, bigotry—tyranny in all shapes. A Rothschild
might earn an unstained fame, as great as yet has been
attained by man, by organizing such a power, and presiding
at its councils.</p>

<p>The influence of long continued impression, constituting
instinct or habit of breed, is a curious phenomenon in
the animal economy. Our population in the eastern
maritime districts of Britain, descended principally from
the Scandinavian rover, though devoted for a time to agricultural
or mechanical occupation, betake themselves,
when opportunity offers, to their old
element, the ocean<a class="afnanc" href="#fn68" id="fnm68">68</a>, <span class="xxpn" id="p370">{370}</span>
and launch out upon the “wintry wave” with much of
the same home-felt composure as does the white polar
bear. They roam over every sea and every shore, from
Behring’s Straits to Magellan’s, with as little solicitude as
the Kelt over his own misty hill, overcoming, in endurance,
the native of the torrid zone under his vertical sun,
and the native of the frigid among his polar snows.</p>

<p>To what may we ascribe the superiority of this portion
of the Caucasian breed,—may it arise in part from its repeated
change of place under favourable circumstances?
Other races have migrated, but not like this, always as
conqueror. The Jew has been a stroller in his time; but
he has improved more in mental acumen and cunning—not
so much in heroism and personal qualities: his proscribed
condition will account for this. The Caucasian
in its progress, will also have mingled slightly, and,
judging from analogy, perhaps advantageously, with the
finer portion of those whom it has overwhelmed. This
breed, by its wide move across the Atlantic, does not
seem at all to have lost vigour, and retains the nautical
and roving instinct unimpaired, although the American
climate is certainly inferior to the European. It is there
rapidly moving west, and may soon have described one
of the earth’s circles. A change of seed, that is, a change
of place, within certain limits of latitude,
is well known <span class="xxpn" id="p371">{371}</span>
to be indispensable to the more sturdy growth and health
of many cultivated vegetables; it is probable that this
also holds true of the human race. There are few countries
where the old breed has not again and again sunk
before the vigour of new immigration; we even see the
worn out breed, chased from their homes to new location,
return, after a time, superior to their former vanquishers,
or gradually work their way back in peace, by superior
subsisting power: this is visible in France, where the aboriginal
sallow Kelt, distinguished by high satyr-like
feature, deep-placed sparkling brown or grey eye, narrowed
lower part of the face, short erect vertebral column,
great mental acuteness, and restless vivacity, has
emerged from the holes of the earth, the recesses of the
forests and wastes, into which it had been swept before
the more powerful blue-eyed Caucasian; and being a
smaller, more easily subsisting animal, has, by starving
and eating out, been gradually undermining the breed of
its former conquerors. The changes which have been
taking place in France, and which, in many places, leave
now scarcely a trace of the fine race which existed twenty
centuries ago, may, however, in part, be accounted for by
the admixture of the Caucasian and Keltic tending more
to the character of the latter, from the latter being a
purer and more fixed variety, and nearer the original type
or medium standard of man; and from the warm dry
plains of France (much drier from cultivation and the reduction
of the forests), having considerable influence to increase
this bias: In some of
the south-eastern departments, <span class="xxpn" id="p372">{372}</span>
more immediately in the tide of the ingress of the Caucasian,
where the purest current has latest flowed, and
the climate is more suitable, and also in some of the maritime
districts, where the air is moister, and to which
they have been seaborn at a later period, the Caucasian
character is still prominent. Something of this, yet not
so general, is occurring in Britain, where the fair bright-blooded
race is again giving place to the darker and more
sallow. This may, however, be partly occasioned by
more of artificial heat and shelter and other consequences
of higher civilization. There seems to be something connected
with confinement and sedentary life, with morbid
action of the liver, or respiratory or transpiratory organs,
which tends to this change under dry and hot, and especially
confined atmosphere. Perhaps imagination is also
a worker here; and the colour most regarded, as snow in
cold countries, black among colliers, white among
bleachers, or even the dark colour of dress, may produce
its peculiar impression, and our much looked-up-to Calvinistic
priesthood, from the pulpit, disseminate darkness
as well as light.</p>

<p>Our own Kelt has indubitably improved much since,
<i>par necessité</i>, he took to the mountain; but, though
steadily enduring, when there is mental excitement, he
has acquired a distaste to dull hopeless unceasing labour,
and would fare scantily and lie hard, rather than submit
to the monotonous industry of the city operative, or the
toil of the agricultural drudge. Though once a fugitive,
the Kelt is now, in moral courage
and hardihood, equal <span class="xxpn" id="p373">{373}</span>
perhaps to any other, yet he still trembles to put foot on
ocean.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that change of place, simply, may
have impression to improve the species, yet is it more to
circumstances connected with this change, to which the
chief part of the improvement must be referred. In the
agitation which accompanies emigration, the ablest in
mind and body—the most powerful varieties of the race
will be thrown into their natural position as leaders, impressing
the stamp of their character on the people at
large, and constituting the more reproductive part; while
the feebler or more improvident varieties will generally
sink under the incidental hardships. When a swarm
emigrates from a prosperous hive, it also will generally
consist of the more adventurous stirring spirits, who,
with the right of conquerors, will appropriate the finest
of the indigenæ which they overrun; their choice of these
being regulated by personal qualities, not by the adventitious
circumstances of wealth or high birth—a regard to
which certainly tends to deteriorate the species, and is
one of the causes which renders the noblesse of Europe
comparatively inferior to the Asiatic, or rather the Christian
noblesse to the Mahometan.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that our finest, most acute population,
exist in the neutral ground, where the Caucasian
and Keltic have mixed, but this may arise from other
causes than admixture. Our healthiest and poorest country
borders the Highlands, and the population enjoy more
of the open air. Our eastern population,
north of the <span class="xxpn" id="p374">{374}</span>
natural division of Flamboroughead, are also harder and
sharper featured, and keener witted, than those southward,
who may be styled our fen-bred. There is no
doubt more of Keltic blood mingled with the north division;
but the sea-born breeds have also been different,
those more northerly being Scandinavian, and the more
southerly consisting of the native of Lower Germany and
the heavy Fleming. The placid-looking Englishman,
more under the control of animal enjoyment, though
perhaps not so readily acute, excels in the no less valuable
qualities of constancy and bodily powers of exertion;
and when properly taught under high division of
labour, becomes a better operative in his particular employment,
and even will sometimes extend scientific discovery
further, than his more mercurial northern neighbour,
who, from his quick wits being generally in advance
of his manual practice, seldom attains to the dexterity
which results from the combination of continued bodily action
and restricted mental application. There exists, however,
very considerable intellectual capacity in this English
breed, but it too frequently is crushed under the preponderance
of the animal part, affording that purest specimen
of vulgarity, the English clown. But, independently
of climate and breed, a great part of the low
Englander’s obtuseness is referable to his being entailed
lord of the soil, under poor-rate law, contravening a natural
law (see note B), so that, when unsuccessful or out
of employment, he, without effort to obtain some new
means of independent subsistence, sinks
into the parish <span class="xxpn" id="p375">{375}</span>
or work-house labourer. On the contrary, the Scotsman,
with no resource but in himself, with famine always in
the vista, as much in his view as a principle of action in
material affairs as his strong perception of the right in
moral, and also under the stimulus of a high pride, leaves
no means untried at home; and, when fairly starved out of
his native country, among various resources, often invades
the territory of his more easy-minded southern neighbour,
where his acuteness seldom fails to find out a convenient
occupation, in which manual dexterity is second to economy
and forethought—his success exciting the wonder
and envy of the dull-witted native.</p>

<p>It would appear, that the finest portion, at least apparently
so, of the north temperate zone, between the parallels
of 30° and 48° latitude, when nearly of the level
of the ocean, is not so favourable for human existence as
the more northern part between 50° and 60°, or even the
torrid zone. The native of the north of Europe has a superior
development of person, and a much longer reproductory
life than the native of the south, which more
than counterbalances the earlier maturity of the latter in
power of increase. Independent of the great current of
population setting south in the northern part of the temperate
zone, there seems even to be some tendency to a
flux northward, from the confines of the torrid; but this
arises rather from the unsteadiness of the seasons, and
consequent deficit of food, at particular times, than from
a steady increase of population. <span class="xxpn" id="p376">{376}</span></p>

<p>Our milder moods, benevolence, gentleness, contemplation—our
refinement in sentiment—our “lovely dreams
of peace and joy,” have negative weight in the balance
of national strength. The rougher excitement of hatred,
ambition, pride, patriotism, and the more selfish passions,
is necessary to the full and strong development of our active
powers. That Britain is leaving the impress of her
energy and morality on a considerable portion of the
world, is owing to her having first borne fire and sword
over these countries: the husbandman tears up the glebe,
with all its covering of weeds and flowers, before he commit
his good seed to the earth. Life and death—good
and evil—pleasure and pain, are the principles of impulse
to the scheme or machine of nature, as heat and
cold are to the steam-engine, thus moving in necessary
alternate dependence. Our moral sense, our perception
and love of good, could not exist without the knowledge
of evil; yet, we shudder at the truth of evil being part
and portion of nature.</p>

<p>There cannot be a more striking proof of the necessity
of a better representation of the marine interest, than the
fact, that our trading vessels are constructed
of an <span class="xxpn" id="p377">{377}</span>
unsuitable figure, owing to the improper manner of measuring
the register tonnage. In order to save a little trouble of
calculation to the surveying officer in gauging the contents
of the vessel, the law directs him merely to take the length
and breadth at the widest place, and from these lines, by
a regular formula, to compute the tonnage; the vessel
paying the charges for lights and harbours, and other
dues, in proportion to this measurement. The result is,
that, in order to lessen these dues individually, our vessels
are constructed deep in proportion to breadth, consequently
are sluggish sailers, and not nearly so safe and
pleasant sea-boats as they otherwise would be—many a
ship, especially with light cargo, getting on her beam-ends
and foundering, or not standing up under canvass
to weather a lee shore. The influence of this absurd
measurement law is the more unlucky, as the ship-owner,
from a deep vessel being, in proportion to the capacity of
the hold, cheaper than one of shallower or longer dimensions,
is already more disposed to construct his vessel
deeper than is consistent with the safety of the seamen
and security of the ship and cargo, the particular insurance
of a deep vessel not being greater than that of one
of safer proportions. The injurious effect from vessels
being constructed on the principles of avoiding tolls or
dues, rather than for sailing, will occur to every one.
We need not say that all this flows from the ignorance
or carelessness of the constructors of our Parliamentary
acts, consequent to defective representation.

<p>In the case of the upper carse on the Tay Firth, there
is evidence, both from its vestiges and from records, that
it had occupied, at least, the entire firth, or sea-basin,
above Broughty Ferry, and that about 50 square miles of
this carse has been carried out into the German Ocean
by the strong sea-tide current, a consequence of the lowering
of the German Ocean, and of the deepening of the
outlet of this sea-basin at Broughty Ferry, apparently by
this very rapid sea-tide current. This carse appears to
have been a general deposition at the bottom of a lake
having only a narrow outlet communicating with the sea,
and probably did not rise much higher than the height of
the bottom of the outlet at that time.</p>

<p>An increase of deposition of alluvium, or prevention of
decrease, may, in many cases, be accomplished by artificial
means. The diminution of the carse of the Tay was
in rapid progress about sixty years ago, the sea-bank
being undermined by the waves of the basin, the clay
tumbling down, becoming diffused in the water, and
being carried out to sea, by every ebbing tide, purer
water returning from the ocean the next tide-flow. This
decrease was stopped by the adoption of stone embanking
and dikes. A small extension of the carses of present
high-water level, in the upper part of the firths of Tay
and Forth, has lately been effected, by forming brushwood,
stone and mud dikes, to
promote the accumulation. <span class="xxpn" id="p379">{379}</span>
In doing this, the whole art consists in placing obstructions
to the current and waves, so that whatever deposition
takes place at high-water, or at the beginning of the
flood-tide, when the water is nearly still, may not again
be raised and carried off.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this accumulation, and also the prevention
of further waste of the superior carse, the deepening
of the Tay Firth, formerly carse, and of the gorge
at Broughty Ferry, seems still in progress, and could not,
without very considerable labour, be prevented. In the
case, however, of the sea-basin of Montrose, a little labour,
from the narrowness of the gorges, would put it in
a condition to become gradually filled with mud. Not a
great deal more expenditure than what has sufficed to
erect the suspension-bridge over its largest outlet, would
have entirely filled up this outlet, and the smaller outlet
might have been also filled to within several feet of high-water,
and made of sufficient breadth only, to emit the
water of the river, which flows into the basin. The
floated sand and mud of this river, thus prevented from
being carried out to sea, would, in the course of years,
completely fill up the basin.</p>

<p>From some vestiges of the upper carse, as well as of
the lower or submarine carse, in situations where their
formation cannot easily be traced to any local cause, it
seems not improbable that the basin of the German sea
itself, nearly as far north as the extent of Scotland, had
at one time been occupied with a carse or delta, a continuation
of Holland, formed by the
accumulation of the <span class="xxpn" id="p380">{380}</span>
diluvium of the rivers which flow into this basin, together
with the molluscous exuviæ of the North Sea, and
the abrasion of the Norwegian coast and Scottish islands,
borne downward by the heavy North Sea swell.</p>

<p>In the case of the delta of Holland having extended so
far northward, a subsidence of the land or rising of the
sea, so as to form a passage for the waters round Britain,
must have occurred. The derangement, at several
places, of the fine wavy stratification of these carses, and
the confusedly heaped-up beds of broken sea-shells, shew
that some great rush of water had taken place, probably
when Belgium was dissevered from England. Since the
opening of the bottom of the gulf, the accumulation may
have been undergoing a gradual reduction, by more diffused
mud<a class="afnanc" href="#fn69" id="fnm69">69</a> being carried off from the German Sea into
the Atlantic and North Sea, than what the former is receiving—the
same process taking place here as has been
occurring in the basin of the Tay. The large sand-banks
on the Dutch and English coast,—in some places,
such as the Goodwin Sands, certainly the heavier, less
diffusible part of the former alluvial country, and portions
of these alluvial districts being retained by artificial
means,—bear a striking resemblance to the <span class="xxpn" id="p381">{381}</span>
sand-banks of the sea basin of the Tay—the less diffusible remains
of the removed portion of the alluvium which had
once occupied all that basin, and to the remaining portion
of the alluvium also retained by artificial means.</p>

<p>Throughout this volume, we have felt considerable inconvenience,
from the adopted dogmatical classification
of plants, and have all along been floundering between
species and variety, which certainly under culture soften
into each other. A particular conformity, each after its
own kind, when in a state of nature, termed species, no
doubt exists to a considerable degree. This conformity
has existed during the last forty centuries. Geologists discover
a like particular conformity—fossil species—through
the deep deposition of each great epoch, but they also
discover an almost complete difference to exist between
the species or stamp of life, of one epoch from that of
every other. We are therefore led to admit, either of a
repeated miraculous creation; or of a power of change,
under a change of circumstances, to belong to living organized
matter, or rather to the congeries of inferior life,
which appears to form superior. The derangements and
changes in organized existence, induced by a change of
circumstance from the interference of
man, affording us <span class="xxpn" id="p382">{382}</span>
proof of the plastic quality of superior life, and the likelihood
that circumstances have been very different in
the different epochs, though steady in each, tend strongly
to heighten the probability of the latter theory.</p>

<p>When we view the immense calcareous and bituminous
formations, principally from the waters and atmosphere,
and consider the oxidations and depositions which have
taken place, either gradually, or during some of the great
convulsions, it appears at least probable, that the liquid
elements containing life have varied considerably at different
times in composition and in weight; that our atmosphere
has contained a much greater proportion of
carbonic acid or oxygen; and our waters, aided by excess
of carbonic acid, and greater heat resulting from greater
density of atmosphere, have contained a greater quantity
of lime and other mineral solutions. Is the inference
then unphilosophic, that living things which are proved
to have a circumstance-suiting power—a very slight
change of circumstance by culture inducing a corresponding
change of character—may have gradually accommodated
themselves to the variations of the elements
containing them, and, without new creation, have presented
the diverging changeable phenomena of past and present
organized existence.</p>

<p>The destructive liquid currents, before which the hardest
mountains have been swept and comminuted into
gravel, sand, and mud, which intervened between and divided
these epochs, probably extending over the whole
surface of the globe, and destroying
nearly all living <span class="xxpn" id="p383">{383}</span>
things, must have reduced existence so much, that an
unoccupied field would be formed for new diverging
ramifications of life, which, from the connected sexual
system of vegetables, and the natural instincts of animals
to herd and combine with their own kind, would fall into
specific groups, these remnants, in the course of time,
moulding and accommodating their being anew to the
change of circumstances, and to every possible means of
subsistence, and the millions of ages of regularity which
appear to have followed between the epochs, probably
after this accommodation was completed, affording fossil
deposit of regular specific character.</p>

<p>There are only two probable ways of change—the
above, and the still wider deviation from present occurrence,—of
indestructible or molecular life (which seems
to resolve itself into powers of attraction and repulsion
under mathematical figure and regulation, bearing a slight
systematic similitude to the great aggregations of matter),
gradually uniting and developing itself into new
circumstance-suited living aggregates, without the presence
of any mould or germ of former aggregates, but
this scarcely differs from new creation, only it forms a
portion of a continued scheme or system.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to trace, in the former way, the principle
of these changes of fashion which have taken place
in the domiciles of life, the following questions occur:
Do they arise from admixture of species nearly allied
producing intermediate species? Are they <i>the diverging
ramifications</i> of the living principle
under modification of <span class="xxpn" id="p384">{384}</span>
circumstance? Or have they resulted from the combined
agency of both? Is there only one living principle?
Does organized existence, and perhaps all material existence,
consist of one Proteus principle of life capable of
gradual circumstance-suited modifications and aggregations,
without bound under the solvent or motion-giving
principle, heat or light? There is more beauty and unity
of design in this continual balancing of life to circumstance,
and greater conformity to those dispositions of
nature which are manifest to us, than in total destruction
and new creation. It is improbable that much of
this diversification is owing to commixture of species
nearly allied, all change by this appears very limited, and
confined within the bounds of what is called Species;
the progeny of the same parents, under great difference
of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become
distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction.</p>

<p>The self-regulating adaptive disposition of organized
life may, in part, be traced to the extreme fecundity of
Nature, who, as before stated, has, in all the varieties of
her offspring, a prolific power much beyond (in many
cases a thousandfold) what is necessary to fill up the
vacancies caused by senile decay. As the field of existence
is limited and pre-occupied, it is only the hardier,
more robust, better suited to circumstance individuals,
who are able to struggle forward to maturity, these inhabiting
only the situations to which they have superior adaptation
and greater power of occupancy than any other
kind; the weaker, less
circumstance-suited, being <span class="xxpn" id="p385">{385}</span>
prematurely destroyed. This principle is in constant action, it
regulates the colour, the figure, the capacities, and instincts;
those individuals of each species, whose colour
and covering are best suited to concealment or protection
from enemies, or defence from vicissitude and inclemencies
of climate, whose figure is best accommodated to
health, strength, defence, and support; whose capacities
and instincts can best regulate the physical energies to
self-advantage according to circumstances—in such immense
waste of primary and youthful life, <i>those</i> only
come forward to maturity from the strict ordeal by which
Nature tests their adaptation to her standard of perfection
and fitness to continue their kind by reproduction.</p>

<p>From the unremitting operation of this law acting in
concert with the tendency which the progeny have to
take the more particular qualities of the parents, together
with the connected sexual system in vegetables, and instinctive
limitation to its own kind in animals, a considerable
uniformity of figure, colour, and character, is induced,
constituting species; the breed gradually acquiring
the very best possible adaptation of these to its condition
which it is susceptible of, and when alteration of circumstance
occurs, thus changing in character to suit these
as far as its nature is susceptible of change.</p>

<p>This circumstance-adaptive law, operating upon the
slight but continued natural disposition to sport in the
progeny (seedling variety), does not preclude the supposed
influence which volition or sensation may have over the
configuration of the body. To examine
into the <span class="xxpn" id="p386">{386}</span>
disposition to sport in the progeny, even when there is only one
parent, as in many vegetables, and to investigate how
much variation is modified by the mind or nervous sensation
of the parents, or of the living thing itself during
its progress to maturity; how far it depends upon external
circumstance, and how far on the will, irritability
and muscular exertion, is open to examination and experiment.
In the first place, we ought to investigate its
dependency upon the preceding links of the particular
chain of life, variety being often merely types or approximations
of former parentage; thence the variation of the
family, as well as of the individual, must be embraced
by our experiments.</p>

<p>This continuation of family type, not broken by casual
particular aberration, is mental as well as corporeal,
and is exemplified in many of the dispositions or instincts
of particular races of men. These innate or continuous
ideas or habits, seem proportionally greater in
the insect tribes, those especially of shorter revolution;
and forming an abiding memory, may resolve much of
the enigma of instinct, and the foreknowledge which
these tribes have of what is necessary to completing their
round of life, reducing this to knowledge, or impressions,
and habits, acquired by a long experience. This
greater continuity of existence, or rather continuity of
perceptions and impressions, in insects, is highly probable;
it is even difficult in some to ascertain the particular
stops when each individuality commences, under
the different phases of egg, larva, pupa, or
if much <span class="xxpn" id="p387">{387}</span>
consciousness of individuality exists. The continuation of
reproduction for several generations by the females alone
in some of these tribes, tends to the probability of the
greater continuity of existence, and the subdivisions of
life by cuttings, at any rate must stagger the advocate
of individuality.</p>

<p>Among the millions of <i>specific varieties</i> of living things
which occupy the humid portion of the surface of our
planet, as far back as can be traced, there does not appear,
with the exception of man, to have been any particular
engrossing race, but a pretty fair balance of powers
of occupancy,—or rather, most wonderful variation of
circumstance parallel to the nature of every species, as if
circumstance and species had grown up together. There
are indeed several races which have threatened ascendency
in some particular regions, but it is man alone from
whom any general imminent danger to the existence of
his brethren is to be dreaded.</p>

<p>As far back as history reaches, man had already had
considerable influence, and had made encroachments
upon his fellow denizens, probably occasioning the destruction
of many species, and the production and continuation
of a number of varieties or even species, which
he found more suited to supply his wants, but which,
from the infirmity of their condition—not having undergone
selection by the law of nature, of which we have
spoken, cannot maintain their ground without his culture
and protection.</p>

<p>It is, however, only in the present age
that man has <span class="xxpn" id="p388">{388}</span>
begun to reap the fruits of his tedious education, and has
proven how much “knowledge is power.” He has now
acquired a dominion over the material world, and a consequent
power of increase, so as to render it probable that
the whole surface of the earth may soon be overrun by
this engrossing anomaly, to the annihilation of every
wonderful and beautiful variety of animated existence,
which does not administer to his wants principally as laboratories
of preparation to befit cruder elemental matter
for assimilation by his organs.</p>

<p class="padtopa">In taking a retrospective glance at our pages from the
press, we notice some inaccuracy and roughness, which
a little more timely attention to <i>training</i> and <i>pruning</i>
might have obviated; the facts and induction may, however,
outbalance these.</p>

<p>We observe that Fig. <i>d</i>,
p. <a href="#p027" title="go to p. 27">27</a>, from the want of proper
shading, and error in not marking the dotted lines, does
not serve well to illustrate our purpose. This figure is
intended to represent a tree of a short thick stem, dividing
into four branches, springing out regularly in the
manner of a cross, nearly at right angles with the stem.
These branches cut over about three or four feet out
from the division, form each one wing of a knee, and
the stem, quartered longitudinally through the heart,
forms the other wing. It is of great advantage to have
four branches rather than two or three, as the stem, divided
into four, by being twice cut down the middle,
forms the wings nearly square;
whereas, when divided <span class="xxpn" id="p389">{389}</span>
into two, the halves are broad and flat, and a considerable
loss of timber takes place; besides, the two branches afford
a thicker wing than the flat half of the stem does when
squared. When the tree separates into three branches,
the stem does not saw out conveniently; and when divided,
the cleft part is angular, and much loss of timber
also takes place in the squaring. When the stem divides
into four branches, each of these branches coincides
in thickness with the quartered stem, and the knees are
obtained equally thick throughout, without any loss of
timber. The four branches, at six or eight feet above the
division, may with a little attention be thrown into a
rectangular bend, and thus give eight knees from each
tree. Knees are generally required of about eight inches
in diameter, and three and a half feet in length of wing;
but when they are to be had thicker and longer, a foot or
more in thickness, and from four to ten feet in length of
wing, they are equally in request, suiting for high rising
floors or heel-knees.</p>

<p>The directions for forming larch roots into knees after
the tree is grubbed, are also not very explicit. The stem
of the tree is cut over nearly the same distance from the
bulb as the length of the root spurs; this quartered
through the heart (in the same manner as above), forms
one wing of the knee, and the four spurs form the other
wings. The same advantage results from having four
regular root-spurs in larch, as in having four regular
branches in oak: the two processes are quite similar,
only the roots in the one case, and the branches in the
other, form one wing
of the knees. <span class="xxpn" id="p390">{390}</span></p>

<p>We have given no directions for the bending of plank
timber. In larch, the wind generally gives the slight
necessary bend to a sufficient proportion; and in oak,
the trees frequently grow a little bent of their own accord.</p>

<p>A foot-note has been omitted, stating, that the plan of
bending young trees, by tying them to an adjacent tree,
intended to be soon removed, belongs, as we are informed,
to Mr Loudon.</p>

<p>We regret that our allusion to the lamented Mr Huskisson
was printed off before we knew of his death.</p>

<hr class="hr34" />

<p>Since this volume went to press, there has been some
changes of scenery on the political European stage, <i>even
rivalling</i> what has ever been accomplished of sylvan metamorphosis
on the face of nature by Sir Henry Steuart.
The intense interest excited by these efforts towards the
regeneration of man, has completely thrown into shade
our humbler subject—the regeneration of trees. We
have even forgot it ourselves in the hands of the printer,
while yet unborn. These sudden transformations altering
the political and moral relations of man, also render
a number of our observations not quite apposite, and our
speculations, some of them, rather “prophetic of the
past.” They, by obliterating national distinctions, and
diminishing the occasions for going to war, will, it is
hoped, bring the European family closer into amity. At
any rate, they have completely thrown
out the <span class="xxpn" id="p391">{391}</span>
calculations of our politicians regarding the balance of power
and international connection as natural allies and foes,
and bind the French and the British together by ties on
the surest principle of friendly sympathy, “<i>idem velle
atque nolle</i>,” which no Machiavellian policy of cabinets,
nor waywardness of political head, will be able to sunder.</p>

<p>We had intended to bring out Naval Timber and Arboriculture
as a portion of a work embracing Rural Economy
in general, but this is not a time to think of rural
affairs.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO THE APPENDIX.</h3>

<ul><li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm67" id="fn67">67</a>.
The very extended sway, the state of civilization considered,
of the Tartar, was evidently the consequence of the great
facility of communication from the plain open surface of the
country, and the equestrian habits of the people.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm68" id="fn68">68</a>.
The habit of breed is apparent in many places of the world. Where
a fine river washes the walls of some of the internal towns of France,
scarce a boat is to be seen, except the long tract-boats
employed in the
conveyance of fire-wood—nobody thinks of sailing for pleasure. The
Esquimaux, and the Red Indian of North America, inhabiting the same
country, shew an entirely distinct habit of breed. The Black and the
Copper-coloured native of the Australian Islands, are equally opposed
in instinctive habit.</p></li>

<li class="lifn">

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlbl" href="#fnm69" id="fn69">69</a>.
The sea water from Flamborough-head, southward to the Straits
of Dover, is generally discoloured with mud; and during every breeze
takes up an addition from the bottom, which is an alluvium so unstable
and loose, that no sea vegetation can hold in it. From not producing
herbage, the general basis of animal life, few fishes or shells can find
support in it.</p></li></ul>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
